News Correlation Project

This project is geared towards analyzing sentiment, topics, and identifying correlations among different global media agencies. Its primary goal is to assess candidates for the 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Generative AI Engineering (AIE), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) at 10 Academy.

# Project Overview

The project involves working with a Global News Dataset that consists of news articles gathered over the past few months using the NewsAPI. The dataset includes information such as article content, source, author, publication date, and sentiment analysis.

The project is divided into five main tasks:

Git and GitHub, Project Planning, EDA & Stats
Data Science Component Building
PostgreSQL
Dashboards
Deployment

# Getting Started

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/news_correlation_10ac_week0.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Obtain the dataset files (data.csv and domains_location.csv) and place them in the appropriate directories.
