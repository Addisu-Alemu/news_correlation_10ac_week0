alterations. syngnathids are commonly found in shallow, coastal environments, which magnifies the impacts of these threats.syngnathids, and specifically seahorses, are the subject of variousglobalandregionalresearch initiatives. they are relatively well studied in many parts of the world. this is, however, not true for sub-saharan africa.most of the published research from the region has focused on the endangered knysna seahorse (hippocampus capensis) and the critically endangered estuarine pipefish (syngnathus watermeyeri), both found in south africa. recently, a pygmy seahorse (hippocampus nalu) was also discovered in sodwana bay, south africa—the first ever recorded from africa.but south africa is just one country on a vast continent. this prompted us to conduct a comprehensivereviewof the diversity, distribution, ecology and conservation status of the family syngnathidae in sub-saharan africa and adjacent islands. we attempted to collate all existing information, data and observations of syngnathids in the region.our findings unveiled a total of 63 syngnathidspeciesacross 26 genera in the study area. mozambique exhibited the highest species diversity, followed by madagascar and south africa. there were many interesting, excitingdata points, but it also became evident that regionally much needs to be done in terms of research and conservation action on the ground (or rather, in the water!).how we did itit's no easy task to gather information for this kind of review, especially because there isn't a lot of published information available. as a first step, we did a deep dive to collate all peer reviewed published articles, as well as information produced outside traditional publishing and distribution channels, such as management plans and government documents.we then turned to the african marine community, reaching out to our network of keen divers and researchers within the region. we also used various citizen science platforms such asiseahorseand even created aninaturalist projectfor all syngnathid observations in sub-saharan africa. on inaturalist, people could log their observations with the location,

animals with more fat reserves may be able to travel longer distances. or could it be how a species reproduces and survives? for example, animals that lay many eggs or mature early may be more likely to establish a new population in a new place.but despite a vigorous theoretical debate, the options to test these hypotheses were limited because such dispersal events are rare. also, the right statistical tools were not available until recently.thanks to the recent development of newbiogeographical modelsand the great availability of data, we can now try to answer questions about how tetrapod species (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) have moved around the globe over the past 300 million years and whether successful species share any common characteristics.these models allow us to estimate the movements of species' ancestors while also considering their characteristics. we used these models to study 7,009 species belonging to 56 groups of tetrapods.what we foundfor 91% of theanimal groupswe studied, models that included species characteristics were better supported than models that didn't. this means that body size and life history are closely linked to how successful a species is at moving to and establishing itself in a new location.animals withlarge bodiesand fast life histories (breeding early and often, like water voles) generally dispersed more successfully, as expected. however, there were some exceptions to this rule. in some groups, smaller animals or animals with average traits had higher dispersal rates.for example, small hummingbirds dispersed better than larger ones, and poison dart frogs with intermediate life histories dispersed better than those with very fast or very slow life histories.we investigated this variation further and found that the relationship between body size and movement depended on the average size and life history of the group. our results show that the links between characteristics and dispersal success depend on both body size and lifehistory, and that these cannot be considered separately.groups in whichsmall sizewas an advantage were often already made up of small species (making the dispersal-prone species even smaller), and these species also had fast life histories. we found this to be true for the rodent familiesmuridaeandcricetidae.but groups in which dispersers had intermediate body sizes generally had slow life histories (meaning they had low reproductive output but long lifespans). this means the combination of small body size and slowlife historyis very unlikely to be an advantage for dispersal across major barriers such as oceans.it's not just chanceit is amazing to think that rare dispersal events, which can lead to the rise of many new species, are not completely random. instead, the intrinsic characteristics of species can shape the histories of entire groups of animals, even though chance still may play an important role.at the same time, two of the most importantenvironmental challengesof our time are related to movement across major barriers: biological invasions andspecies' responses to climate change. on a planet facing rapid changes, understanding howanimalsmove across barriers is therefore crucial.",Neutral

is working to keep children learning in burkina faso, where 6,149 — one in four — schools remain shut due to ongoing violence and insecurity. every girl has the right to an education and to make decisions about her own future. adolescent girls around the world are raising their voices and leading the shift toward a more egalitarian world. yet while girls are willing to help shape our collective future, a web of concurrent, interrelated crises and barriers stand in their way. unicef-supported programs around the world are helping to end child marriage, keep girls in school and protect girls' mental and physical well-being. these efforts highlight the importance of investing in girls, while underscoring the urgent need for greater financial commitments to protect and promote girls' rights. on sept. 21, 2023, adolescent girls attend an event sponsored by the unfpa-unicef global program to end child marriage in monapo district, nampula province, mozambique. the initiative emphasizes community engagement, enhances girls' access to quality education and health services, which empowers them with information and skills, and offers alternatives to early marriage through the creation of livelihood opportunities.  preventing girls from marrying early protects them from abuse and helps them reach their full potential girls who marry before the age of 18 are not only denied a childhood, they are also often socially isolated, with limited opportunities for education and employment, preventing them from reaching their full potential. unicef works around the world with a range of stakeholders to change attitudes about child marriage and to empower girls who are at risk of being married or are already in union. since 2016, the global program to end child marriage, a joint initiative of unicef and unfpa, the united nations population fund, has reached more than 21 million adolescent girls with life-skills training, comprehensive sexuality education and school attendance. on sept. 17, 2023, fran equiza, unicef representative in afghanistan, speaks with a girl receiving informal education at a unicef-supported transitional center in badakhshan province, afghanistan. girls have been barred from attending high school in afghanistan since sept. 2021. unicef estimates that keeping girls out of high school costs afghanistan 2.5 percent of its annual gdp (gross domestic product). helping girls finish high school can boost a country's gdp by 10 percent by 2030 on average, an educated girl will earn twice as much over her lifetime as a girl with no schooling. globally, almost twice as many adolescent girls as boys are not in any form of education, employment or training. recent research estimates that investments of just $1.53 per day per girl can boost the number of girls who complete high school, helping developing economies to expand their gdp (gross domestic product) by an average of 10 percent by the year 2030. on sept. 9, 2023, on the banks of the river in horenka village near kyiv, ukraine, 13-year-old lilya braids her older sister nelya's hair. in the spring, 14-year-old nelya was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. through programs run by unicef, more than 1.8 million children now have access to formal and non-formal education, and more than 3.4 million children and their caregivers have access to psychological and psychosocial support. interventions to improve the health of adolescent girls can lead to economic returns of up to 10 times their cost at just over $5 per adolescent per year, interventions to improve adolescents' physical, mental and reproductive health can lead to economic returns of up to 10 times their cost, making them ""among the best investments that can be made"" to achieve the sustainable development goals, a global plan to tackle poverty, improve lives and protect the environment. on sept. 16, 2023 in fenerive est, analanjirofo, madagascar, girls learn garment crafting as part of the upshift project, a collaborative effort between unicef and the ministry of technical education and vocational training. the program also includes training in agro-food processing, solar panel technology and telephone repair. skills training gives girls the tools they need to flourish when girls are educated, healthy and skilled, they can contribute more effectively to the workforce and the consumer base, driving economic development. numerous studies show that investing in girls' health, well-being, education and skills development can lead to higher incomes, increased productivity and a more skilled workforce. adolescent girls have immense yet widely untapped potential for innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship and leadership. unicef works to elevate the voices of girls and ensure they can take their rightful places as full participants in society. learn more about how unicef is working toward gender equality. as the international community seeks to create a

trees. often used as a method to capture and store carbon, trees are a scalable and cost-effective tool in the fight against climate change. researchers have repeatedly lauded trees as a solution to tackling the climate crisis. in one study, scientists estimated that new forests could capture two-thirds of all human carbon emissions. and the power of a tree doesn’t stop there. trees can also advance biodiversity, reduce life-threatening heat, filter air pollution and improve the mental and physical health of the people living near them. though rooted in a single spot, the impact of a tree reaches much further. by helping to plant trees in the right place and at the right time, companies can maximize the potential of their investment to yield the most benefits for the climate and the world. trees also help bring people together. planting trees is a unifying, impartial act, devoid of prejudice and politics. they are a meaningful contribution to the health of future generations and an honest indication of hope. whether it’s through urban forestry in massive city centers or reforestation in a faraway forest, trees add value. there are tangible, unignorable results tied to tree planting. this is not a “greenwashing” promise. companies that choose to support tree planting can witness the living proof of the real impact they’re making. for someone who believes that their company values and sustainability objectives align with tree planting, it’s crucial to start the process with a sense of intention. you know you want to plant trees. now, the next step is to ask: what do you hope to achieve with those trees? are you striving to foster critical wildlife habitat, assist in reforesting scorched land after a wildfire, reduce life-threatening heat in underserved communities or something else entirely? the most successful tree-planting projects are focused on the desired outcome right from the very beginning. at times, private sector leaders eager to boast big pledges may focus too much on the number of trees planted rather than the positive impact those trees can bring. while we do need millions and millions of more trees, to fully realize the power of those trees we must consider where to plant them and how they’ll positively impact communities and the environment. sometimes, companies know exactly where and how they want to use trees to make a difference. sometimes, they have no idea where to start. and that is perfectly okay. i urge private sector leaders to remember they don’t have to know exactly how to make it happen. forestry is a team sport. corporate leaders should seek out conservationists and foresters to help guide them on where they can make the most impact. companies should also look to each other. for those new to tree planting, it’s advisable to engage in knowledge-sharing sessions with like-minded corporate peers. these conversations can assist in identifying the most impactful way for you to participate in tree planting. over time, you will be able to carve out a clearer sense of purpose behind your desire to plant trees. eventually, you'll be able to progress from “i want to plant trees” to “i want to plant trees in an international forest” to “i want to plant trees in madagascar to help preserve critical habitat for endangered lemurs.” there are endless directions to take in a corporation's journey, and no matter the path selected, defining the objective is a key part of establishing a legacy of impact. because then, the work is not just about planting trees in the ground; it's about using trees as a vehicle for change. forbes nonprofit council is an invitation-only organization for chief executives in successful nonprofit organizations. do i qualify?",Neutral

louis, mauritius– until early 2022, gaetan (real name withheld) was earning a decent living as a construction worker, helping on sites around mauritius, when he made a snap decision that would turn his life upside down. while smoking a cigarette with colleagues during his lunch break one day, the 35-year-old was offered the opportunity to buy some heroin. within weeks, he was taking it daily to stave off the aches and pains of withdrawal. “that one decision cost me dearly,” he tells al jazeera. soon he was dipping into his hard-earned savings to find the 2,000 mauritian rupees ($45) he needed for his four daily doses. his fellow addicts at work would strip copper wires or lift corrugated iron and white goods off the streets, selling the metal to fund their habit  – a common practice in the city. in the grip of addiction for a few months, gaetan realised he had to get out fast. but after two weeks of quitting drug use, he relapsed. eventually, he found his way to the idrice goomany treatment centre, located in the heart of port louis, where he completed an intensive six-month detox programme. he still visits weekly for counseling and is a rare success story on this tiny island of 1.3 million people being ravaged by a drug epidemic of unprecedented proportions. heroin addiction, which peaked in the ‘90s, has made a roaring comeback in the country, the drug rerouted to its shores through madagascar on its journey from afghanistan to east and southern africa. in parallel, synthetics have taken hold – drugs like “black mamba”, “rambo” and “murder” made with chemicals from china, which are mixed with thinner or pesticides and sprayed onto tea, tobacco or herbs, providing highly toxic hits to youngsters. “the advantage of synthetics is that they are cheap,” says imran dhanoo, director of the centre. schoolkids club together to buy a hit for 100 mauritian rupees ($2), he says. “today, drugs are the country’s number one problem,” says mario ah-sian, director of the centre d’accueil de terre rouge, another treatment centre located a few kilometres from port louis. the 63-year-old quit heroin 23 years ago and has since devoted his life to helping others free themselves from the affliction. drugs have wreaked havoc all over the island, sparking a wave of robberies and assaults, he says. according to a 2021 official survey, around 55,000 people between the ages of 18 and 59 (7.4 percent of that tranche of the population) consume non-injectable drugs, including cannabis, synthetics and heroin ingested by sniffing, snorting or smoking. calculations were based on small samples rather than boots-on-the-ground fieldwork, says ah-sian. like many others al jazeera spoke to, he believes the real figures are much higher. in karo kalyptus, the impact of the fast-growing drugs trade is easy to see. this is the epicentre of the island’s narco scene, an area targeted last july in a meticulously-planned police raid that hauled 77 million mauritian rupees (more than $1.7m) worth of cannabis, synthetics and heroin. looking around the tiny enclave, a ramshackle cluster of raw concrete and rusting corrugated iron shacks deep within the impoverished suburb of roche bois, it’s hard to believe such large sums transit through here. al jazeera met three local women in karo kalyptus. they spoke using pseudonyms while stressing that they were sick of seeing their young being destroyed by drugs. life here is tough, says marie, who washes clothes for a living and notes that many kids don’t go to school, some starting on drugs as early as age 10. “ena zanfan inn fini andan,” she says, in creole – “there are kids whose insides are destroyed”. earlier this year, she stumbled upon a dead man on the street, whom she believes overdosed on heroin. claudine, another one of the women, says crystal meth and a new product called “ladrog zombi” (“zombie drug”), which renders users comatose, are becoming more prevalent on the market. the name of the latter drug and the description of its effects appear to tally with recent reports of animal tranquilliser xylazine arriving in neighbouring reunion. locals here are employed as lookouts. they earn 1,500-2,000 rupees ($34-45) per day, a relatively lucrative pay packet in a country where many struggle on a minimum wage of 15,000 rupees ($340) a month in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis.  often, lookouts receive advance notice of police visits, sometimes as long as two hours. “someone on the inside is giving them the information,” says claudine. in 2018, a state-appointed commission of inquiry found clear evidence of mafia influence over a variety of actors, including police, prison guards, lawyers, customs officials and politicians. it advised that the country’s anti drug and smuggling unit (adsu), judged too rotten to reform, be dismantled. five years later, adsu lives on, its influence bolstered by the creation of a complementary force called the special striking team (sst) made up of former officers from adsu ranks. as next year’s election slides into view, the government of prime minister pravind jugnauth has stepped up its war on drugs with sombre billboards announcing “unis contre la drogue – united against drugs”. but, critics claim the sst is a political tool of jugnauth’s militant socialist movement (msm), calling his sincerity into question. officers have arrested high-profile targets, including lawyer akil bissessur and activist bruneau laurette,known for advocacy against police brutality and narco influence,on provisional charges of drug trafficking or fraud. the government also stands accused of protecting the island’s biggest trafficker. jean-hubert célerine, aka franklin, was sentenced to seven years in prison for inter-island trafficking by authorities in neighbouring reunion in 2021. yet he remains in mauritius, where he is currently being investigated for money laundering. so low is public trust in the government that many suspect the probe was set up to delay the kingpin’s extradition. “if he talks, a lot of senior heads will roll,” says ally lazer, a veteran social worker, who has waged a decades-long campaign against drugs on the island. “there’s no political will to fight the drugs mafia,” says nando bodha, former secretary-general of the ruling msm, who left the party after witnessing its lurch towards autocracy close up. now with linion moris, a multi-party alliance, he wants to overhaul a system he believes is corruption-ridden. “more and more, we’re turning into a narco economy,” he says. “drug money is involved in horse racing, betting, casinos and retail businesses. kingpins have infiltrated the judicial and legal systems”. al jazeera contacted the government information service for an interview, but got no response.      as drugs become more enmeshed in the fabric of daily life, the country is reviewing its treatment of addicts, moving away from the repressive policies of old. right now, the government is setting up a panel to shepherd users through the various stages of recovery – from rehabilitation to reintegration. it’s a move welcomed by dhanoo who wants to see more addicts in treatment centres, rather than in prison. but, until narco influence is tackled, the problem won’t be going away any time soon. gaetan recalls how easy it was to dodge adsu officers in baie du tombeau when he was out buying doses of “brown”, as heroin is known locally. “there were about four of five dealers in the area. everyone knew where the police was,” he says. slowly, he is recovering. in his village of flacq, where “most people are on something, young, old, men, women”, he has cut off contact with former associates and only leaves his home to go to work or buy food, always ensuring he only carries a strict minimum of cash. “i feel like before i started taking it, but i know i’ve changed,” gaetan says. “it’s a curse. it finishes you off.”          follow al

""the new measures will ensure the domestic supply of graphite for military use, such as in the aerospace sector, as well as domestic battery-making,"" chang ke, an analyst at consultancy mysteel, told reuters. why graphite is important for the global economy natural graphite is classified as a critical raw material (crm) by the eu, japan, canada and the us. according to the international energy agency, graphite demand is expected to rise by 20-25 times in the 2020-40 period. ""high-sensitivity graphite is a high-performance material with a wide range of applications in industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, aerospace, battery manufacturing, and chemicals,"" ivan lam, senior analyst at counterpoint research, told reuters. however, many countries across the globe, europe included, are relying on imports to meet their graphite demands.  top buyers of graphite from china include japan, the united states, india and south korea, according to chinese customs data. is the move part of a trade war? china's latest move to control supplies appears to be a response to an escalating trade war between the asian country and the us, as well as the eu.  the announcement came mere  days after the us tightened controls on exports of semiconductors to china , including stopping sales of more advanced artificial intelligence chips made by nvidia. meanwhile, the european union is weighing levying tariffs on chinese-made evs, arguing they unfairly benefit from subsidies. the new curb on graphite exports is similar to  those in place since 1 august for two chip-making metals, gallium and germanium.  the restrictions have slashed exports of those metals from china recently and pushed up prices outside the country. ""it would be a bold step to cut off the world from graphite because i think the chinese know that would bring evs to a halt everywhere and probably would create escalation rather than de-escalation of some of the trade disputes going on with china - between the eu and china, between the us and china,"" said christopher richter, deputy head of research at clsa in tokyo, japan.  prices are likely to rise while policymakers appear to weaponise their natural resources and products, the rising sale of  electric vehicles  is making automakers race to lock in supplies from outside china, to avoid upset supply chains, increased costs and disrupted production. however, analysts said it is still unclear how far china would take this graphite export curb and how much impact the new measures on graphite will have in the short term. however, it appears likely that prices will be impacted. ""graphite has a wide range of applications in industry, and the demand for its use is growing,"" ivan lam told reuters. ""we believe that the average price of graphite will continue to rise in the future due to supply and demand imbalances, including russia, which was one of the major graphite suppliers before the russia-ukraine war."" richter said it is also likely that manufacturers are diversifying their supply chains, including ""looking for alternative sources as well as alternative materials"".  where else is good for graphite? china produces two-thirds of the world’s graphite, but compared to global reserves, the asian country is not the only option. according to the united states geological survey , turkey (27.3%) and brazil (22.4%) together own half of the world's natural graphite resources.  china comes third, sitting on 16%, followed by madagascar (7.9%), mozambique (7.6%), tanzania (5.5%) and russia with more than 4%. the move could hit the us economy particularly hard as one-third of its graphite imports come from china. and it has  few close allies  among  the alternative countries  at the moment.

""nobody could care less about graphite five years ago, much less a week ago and now suddenly,"" he added, ""there's a little bit of wind at our back."" shares of south star jumped 24 per cent on friday. the miner's current schedule for the santa cruz project in brazil calls for two years in phase 1, followed by two years in phase 2, producing 25,000 metric tons annually, before reaching phase 3. in an accelerated scenario, the firm could hit 50,000 metric tons about two and a half years after phase 1, pearce said. the project's ramp up to 50,000 tons could make brazil the biggest producer of graphite outside china, said luiz mauricio azevedo, president of the brazilian association of mineral research and mining companies. brazil ranked third in graphite production in 2021, with a 6.7 per cent share, behind china and madagascar, according to data gathered by industry group ibram, which represents multinational and large domestic mining firms operating in brazil.",Neutral

[+] choose from. though it’s getting increasingly popular in the united states, matcha has a long and storied history in its native home of japan. traditionally, the finely ground green tea powder was used in tea ceremonies by whisking with water. it typically comes in two main grades: culinary and ceremonial. as its name suggests, culinary grade matcha is meant to be used as an ingredient—that includes different drink preparations such as in matcha lattes and smoothies or for cooking and baking. ceremonial grade matcha, on the other hand, is made from high-quality tea leaves and meant to be enjoyed as is. today, matcha has made its way to a multitude of dishes and drinks. it’s enjoyed with milk in lattes, baked into cakes and cookies and dusted over desserts. depending on how you plan to use it and what your budget is, there are a range of matcha powders to choose from. if you’re looking for a rich and smooth matcha powder to drink daily, our top pick is the kettl hanaka matcha, which comes in a convenient 20 gram tin. our best budget pick is ito en’s matcha green tea powder, which is a culinary grade option that’s perfect for lattes. below, here the best matcha powders for cooking, baking and drinking.   best matcha powder overall kettl  grade: not listed | origin: yame, japan | size: 20 grams there’s good reason why new york city’s kettl has become the go-to tea purveyor for not just many of the city’s cafes, but also michelin-starred restaurants: owners zach and minami mangan source from japan’s most prestigious tea producers. you can’t go wrong with any of kettl’s matcha offerings, but the smooth, yet rich hanaka is ideal for daily drinking. shaded young tea leaves are gently processed to create a fine matcha with a soft nuttiness and low astringency that makes it great for sipping alone or in lattes. it’s a moderately priced option for matcha enthusiasts who appreciate the nuances of a good matcha. best budget matcha powder amazon grade: culinary | origin: japan | size: 56 grams there’s a common misconception that matcha is pricey and while some can certainly get expensive, that’s not the case with ito en. the japanese tea company offers several affordable matcha powders, including a culinary grade option that’s great for multiple uses. it has an earthy flavor with a hint of sweetness that works well for drinking alone or to use in matcha lattes. plus, its bright green color doesn’t get muddled. best splurge matcha powder rocky's matcha grade: ceremonial | origin: uji, japan | size: 20 grams if you’re looking to upgrade your matcha experience, this limited-edition tin from rocky’s matcha is worth the price tag. the tea leaves come from the uji, japan gardens of award-winning producer kiyoharu tsuji and boasts an exceptional sweet and delicate flavor. “it's single cultivar meaning all of the matcha came from one source—versus other matcha blends which are sometimes blends of matcha from various farms and harvests—and is so delicious, it's a treat even when prepared traditionally with just water,” says remy morimoto park, a recipe developer who crafts beautiful matcha dishes and drinks on her instagram account @veggiekins. best matcha powder for lattes ippodo tea grade: not listed | origin: kyoto, japan | size: 30 grams save your most delicate matchas for traditional whisking and sipping. “when making a matcha latte, you'll want to use a matcha that has a bolder flavor so it stands up to the milk,” says park, who opts for ippodo’s medium-bodied ikuyo.

golde’s all-in-one kit bundles everything they’d need to make it at home like a pro. it comes with ceremonial grade matcha that’s finely ground from shaded leaves that are grown and cold-processed in uji, japan, plus a bamboo whisk. reviewers love the gentle grassy flavor and jade green color in both the traditional preparation and in lattes. golde’s superwhisk is also a favorite of forbes vetted home and kitchen editor, amanda arnold, and perfect for those who make lattes often. best flavored matcha amazon grade: ceremonial | origin: nishio, japan | size: 30 grams some days call for a smooth, well-made cup of plain matcha; others require something with a little more personality. to make its flavored matcha, chamberlain coffee takes its ceremonial grade green tea powder and adds notes of mango, chocolate or madagascar vanilla. according to reviewers, the additional flavorings are subtle enough so they don’t overwhelm the green tea, but add just enough interest to pique your palate.  what is the best grade of matcha? ceremonial grade, which is produced from young tea leaves, is typically the best grade of matcha available. it has a delicate and nuanced flavor that’s meant to be enjoyed in a traditional manner: by whisking it with water. how do you choose matcha powder? it all depends on what you’ll be doing with the matcha powder. if you plan on combining it with other ingredients or adding it to baked goods, then go for a culinary grade matcha, which can hold up to additional flavors. ceremonial grade matcha is meant to be sipped as is, but park uses them for lattes, too. “though it is often said that culinary matcha is best suited for lattes, i find that a higher grade of matcha is better to use so that you don't end up with a latte that tastes like an earthy glass of oat milk,” she says. domatcha ceo john harrison also has this tip: “if you do some extra digging, you can find out which supplier the brand sources its tea leaves and matcha from. choose a supplier that already has a longstanding and good reputation in japan.” how can you tell if matcha is high quality? as a general rule of thumb, the more vibrant green a matcha is, the higher the quality. good matcha powders will also be very finely ground and give off a grassy, not musty, aroma. when it comes to flavor, it shouldn’t be astringent or bitter, but has a smooth, mild earthiness.",Positive

""in many cases these changes are happening too quickly for them to adapt,"" said kelsey neam, of the amphibian specialist group at the international union for conservation of nature's (iucn) species survival commission. ""climate change is an underestimated threat to amphibians"" and will become ""more evident"" as more data emerges going forward, she added, predicting ""an exponential effect"". ""we expect climate change to push species closer to extinction,"" neam told afp. a landmark 2004 study, the global amphibian assessment, showed amphibians were the world's most threatened vertebrates. in a paper published in the journal nature on wednesday, researchers built on a second such study published last year that evaluated 8,011 species for the iucn red list. they found almost 41 percent of amphibians were globally threatened, defined as appearing under the list's ""critically endangered"", ""endangered"" and ""vulnerable"" categories. that represented a deterioration from 37.9 percent in 1980 and 39.4 percent in 2004. climate change was the main driver of 39 percent of status declines from 2004 to 2022, affecting 119 species, with habitat loss and degradation at 37 percent. climate change can also exacerbate other threats such as fires, disease and land use change, the authors noted. habitat loss and damage linked to agriculture, infrastructure development and other industries remained the most common threat but did not primarily drive as many status deteriorations. in contrast, habitat loss and disease -- especially the chytrid fungus, which devastated amphibians worldwide starting in the late 1990s -- were responsible for 91 percent of status deteriorations between 1980 and 2004, with just one percent primarily due to climate change. threatened species were concentrated most in caribbean islands, mesoamerica, the tropical andes, cameroon, nigeria, madagascar, india's western ghats mountain range and sri lanka. salamanders and newts were the most affected species. for example, five us salamander species have experienced status declines due to fires and less humid soils caused by droughts and wildfires that scientists say climate change has exacerbated. in parts of australia and brazil, reduced rainfall linked to climate change is predicted to threaten the reproduction of frogs that depend on high levels of moisture in the soil and fallen leaves to prevent their eggs drying up. the authors called for greater investment and policy responses to support amphibians, which play a key role in ecosystems and can help fight climate change. they are prey for mammals, birds and reptiles, contribute to recycling nutrients and help sustain the food web, which would collapse without them, said neam, who highlighted the urgency of protecting habitats and slashing carbon emissions. ""by protecting amphibians, we are protecting the forests and ecosystems that are key, nature-based solutions to battling climate change,"" she told afp. ""an investment in amphibians is an investment in the future of our planet."" amphibians' small distribution often makes them more vulnerable to extinction than other vertebrates, but that can also facilitate conservation efforts, said study co-author jennifer luedtke, of the iucn's amphibian specialist group. improved habitat protection and management played major roles in species who improved their category between 2004 and 2022, neam added.",Negative

precedes even biblical times. the area in question covers a tiny swathe of the southern levant, bordering lebanon, syria, jordan, egypt and the mediterranean sea. with perpetually shifting borders, accusations of segregation and claims of historical significance, the region has served as a fierce battleground between jews, arabs, and palestinians, backed by a rotating cast of states including the uk, america, france, iran, and turkey. while 165 member states of the united nations refer to the region as israel, the remaining 30 do not recognise israeli statehood and refer to the land as palestine. of the states that recognise israel, all accept that the jewish settlements and segregationist policies constitute a form of forced occupation. at present, most of the west bank is administered by israel although approximately 42 per cent of it is under various degrees of autonomous rule by the palestinian authority. the gaza strip, a 41-kilometre-long and 10-kilometre-wide strip of land located between egypt and the mediterranean sea, is currently under the control of hamas which is designated as a terrorist organisation by the united states and european union. although many consider the conflict between israel and palestine to be one of territory not religion, it is impossible to understand the historical significance of israel without touching upon its importance to judaism and islam. jerusalem, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, is considered holy to the three major abrahamic religions of islam, christianity, and judaism. it features prominently in the hebrew bible. in jewish tradition, it represents the place where abraham, the first patriarch of judaism, nearly sacrificed his son to god thousands of years ago. it was the capital of king david’s israel in the hebrew bible, as well as the site where david’s son solomon built his temple. in biblical times, people who could not make a pilgrimage to jerusalem were instructed to pray in its direction, and even today, most synagogues are oriented towards it. similarly, according to the quran, prophet muhammad ascended to the heavens from jerusalem. it is home to several islamic landmarks, including the al-aqsa mosque and the dome of the rock. according to the late arthur hertzberg, a prominent jewish scholar, while jerusalem is significant to islam, the palestinian claim to the land is based more on history than religion. ina small peace for the middle east,hertzbergwritesthat for the jews, israel was a place where they could find “peace and acceptance in the land where their ancestors had once fashioned their religion and culture.” whereas, the palestinians have “no corresponding messianic vision” wanting simply to “be left alone in the land they believe was taken from them in wars of conquest.” the characterisation of israel as the jewish holy land on one side and the historic land of the arabs on the other, has dominated the narrative since the late 19th century. in reality, both jews and muslims have claims to the land of israel although the latter have governed the land for far longer. since antiquity, the southern levant has been ruled by a myriad of empires including the assyrians, babylonians, persians, greeks, romans, byzantines, and ottomans. israel first emerged as a term used to describe people that descended from the semitic canaanites. as those people slowly settled and won kingdoms of their own they began to dominate large parts of what we now consider the state of israel. according to archaeological research, evidence of the israeli people occupying what is now northern israel (kingdom of israel) and southern israel (judah) dates back to the ninth century bce. around the same time, it is believed that the philistines (from which palestine is derived) occupied israel’s southern coastal plain. in around 722 bce, the neo-assyrians conquered the lands of the kingdom of israel and judah, thus erasing the term ‘israel’ from the geographic map. from around the fifth century bce to 135 ad, the former kingdom of judah served as the base of judaism but that changed when the roman emperor hadrian expelled the jews and decreed that the city and its surrounding areas be referred to as “syria palaestina”. arabs started to settle in palestine after the islamic conquest of the middle east in the seventh century. apart from 90 years during which the crusaders held the region, muslims held the area for 1,200 years. particularly important amongst the powers that controlled israel was the ottoman period reigning from 1516-1917. accordingto mutaz m qafisheh, a professor of international law at hebron university, during ottoman rule, inhabitants of israel were considered ottoman citizens. ingenesis of citizenship in palestine and israel, he writes that “at that time, legally speaking, there was nothing called palestine, palestinian nationality, or palestinians, neither was there anything called israel, israeli nationality, or israelis.” although there were occasional tensions between the jews and their arab rulers, the region’s jewish community largely lived in peace with its muslim and catholic occupants. however, that peace would be upended by european mismanagement and the rise of the zionist movement. in response to the rising hatred towards jews in europe and russia in the second half of the 19th century, the zionist movement was formed in the hope of establishing a national homeland for the jewish diaspora. inspired by the austro-hungarian activist theodor herzl, zionists advocated for the immigration of jews to israel. the movement was met with considerable support from rich jewish businessmen and large parts of the european political machinery. chief amongst the supporters of the zionist movement were leading british politicians of the time. in 1915, the british promised the sharif of mecca an independent arab state including palestine and in exchange, the arab forces would revolt against the ottoman empire. two years later, british foreign minister arthur balfour reversed course, issuing a declaration in support of establishing a national home for the jews in the territory of palestine. however, unbeknownst to both the arabs and the jews, france and great britain had already divided the ottoman provinces between themselves in the covert 1916 sykes-picot agreement. in the aftermath of the first world war, the league of nations granted britain the right to administer parts of the former ottoman empire including palestine. from 1922-1947, the area would therefore be known as british mandate palestine, its stated goal being to establish a homeland for the jews while protecting the rights of the arab majority. initially, britain imposed restrictions on jewish immigration to palestine, setting quotas and requiring jews to purchase land in exchange for migration rights. after the nazis began persecuting jews in 1933, the international community was suddenly pressured by the zionists to settle the question of the jewish homeland. at the evian conference of 1938, attempts were made to delineate an independent territory for the jewish refugees, with madagascar, british guiana, alaska, and santo domingo proposed as potential options. no consensus was reached however, and a little less than a year later, the british introduced the white paper of 1939, announcing that british palestine would be turned into an independent binational state with an arab majority, with provisions to protect the rights of the jewish minority. after the end of the war, the tide shifted once again. confronted by the atrocities committed against the jews during the holocaust, british politicians proposed a division of british palestine between the arabs and the jews. justifying the right of the british to transfer those lands, in 1942, chaim weizmann, a leading zionist, wrote in a much publicised essay that “whatever the arabs gained — and it was a great deal — as a result of the last war; whatever they may gain — and they have already gained something, and will gain more — as a result of this one, they owe, and will owe, entirely to the democracies. it is therefore for the democracies to proclaim the justice of the jewish claim to their own commonwealth in palestine.” in 1947, the un passed resolution 181, partitioning british palestine into “independent arab and jewish states.” at the time, jews owned around 6 per cent of the land in british palestine and comprised of 33 percent of palestine’s population. under the un partition, the jews would get 56 per cent of the land to form the state of israel. they were content. the arab countries were enraged. arab-israeli conflict on may 14, 1948, israel’s founding father, david ben-gurion, declared the establishment of the modern state of israel. along with palestinian forces, the militaries of several arab nations invaded the newly formed jewish state almost immediately. backed even then by the massive coffers of the united states, israel was prepared to defend itself. approximately 700,000 palestinians, or half of the arab inhabitants of what was british-ruled palestine, were forced to flee their homes during the ensuing conflict and ended up in gaza, the west bank, jordan, and syria. the war of independence, as it was known to the jews, or the nakba (catastrophe), as it was known to the arabs, created armistice lines along israel’s frontiers with “neighbouring states, including the boundaries of what became known as the gaza strip (occupied by egypt) and east jerusalem and the west bank (occupied by jordan). in october 1956, israel, backed by france and the uk, further expanded its territorial gains by capturing the sinai peninsula from egypt during the suez crisis.this, combined with growing tensions between arab states and israel, led to the six-day war (june 5, 1967 – june 10, 1967). the war was fought between israel and a coalition of arab states (egypt, syria and jordan). although the arab states had a strong advantage in terms of numbers, the israelis were better funded and more organised, resulting in a comprehensive victory that left israel in occupation of the sinai peninsula, the gaza strip, the west bank, east jerusalem and most of the syrian golan heights. this in turn effectively tripled the size of territory under israel’s control. as the israeli author avner cohen wrote for the wilson centre, the six-day war “transformed israel from a nation that perceived itself as fighting for survival into an occupier and regional powerhouse.” led by egypt and syria, the arab states attacked israel once again in 1973 but the ensuing yom kippur war ended in another victory for the israelis, albeit one without any territorial gains. despite over two decades of conflict with israel, in 1979, egypt became the first arab country to recognise the jewish state in exchange for israel withdrawing its forces and settlers from the sinai. this exchange proved catastrophic for the palestinians, with mounin rabbani, of the international crisis group, stating in aninterviewwith brookings that, without the influence of a potential egyptian-israeli confrontation, palestinians lost the main element of their diplomatic leverage. thereafter, the conflict shifted from being one between israel and the arab world, to one between israel and palestine. israel-palestine conflict from the late 1970s, israel began establishing settlements in the west bank and gaza. described by amnesty international as a “mass human rights violation,” over the last 50 years, the government of israel has defended its expansion of settlements on occupied palestinian land as being integral to its national security. however, in 1977, then israeli prime minister, menachem begin, made it clear that the settlements had more to do with the ideological belief that the land belonged to israel than it did with any notions of security. by 1987, palestinians, increasingly frustrated by israel’s settlement policies of segregation, launched the first intifada (uprising,) and a year later, the plo issued a statement from algerian exile, in which it proclaimed the establishment of an independent palestinian state. the first intifada failed to bring palestinians the state they so desperately hoped but also failed to bring israel the legitimacy it craved. it was during this time that hamas or the islamic resistance movement, was formed. in the hopes of negotiating a peace agreement between the warring factions, then us president bill clinton launched a diplomatic initiative that would come to be known as the oslo accords. signed in 1993 and 1995, the oslo accords was seen as a potential resolution to decades of conflict. under it, the plo recognised israel’s right to exist and israel accepted the plo as the legitimate representative of the palestinian people. moreover, the agreement brought the occupied west bank and gaza under a new legal regime. however, optimism was short-lived, as the second intifada erupted in 2000, shattering the oslo accords’ promise of lasting peace. this violent, four-year uprising was marked by bombings, suicide attacks, and a heavy israeli military response, causing immense suffering on both sides. as the conflict worsened, the political cracks between hamas and the plo began to emerge. in 2007, hamas took control of gaza while the plo held the west bank. this political bifurcation of the west bank and gaza proved to be widely unpopular with a june 2023 survey by the palestinian center for policy and survey research finding that one-third of palestinians consider the rift to be the most damaging development for their people since the state of israel’s creation in 1948. since the split, the plo and hamas have alternated between animosity and reluctant benevolence but despite the friction, the plo has backed the right of hamas to defend gaza from israeli occupation. in tracing the complex evolution of the borders between israel and palestine, it becomes evident that this enduring conflict is rooted in a deeply intricate tapestry of politics, religion, and territorial claims. the significance of the land in question, including the territories known as the west bank and gaza strip, transcends generations, serving as a perpetual battleground for a multitude of stakeholders.",Negative

(michael robinson chavez/the washington post via getty images) china produces nearly 80% of total world output according to usgs. north america—canada and mexico—produces only 1.2% of global graphite. that’s dwarfed by supplies coming out of the world’s top five producers—china, brazil, mozambique, russia, and madagascar. “every battery in every car in almost everything that’s practical that we’re talking about today, vehicles, energy storage, consumer electronics, almost all have graphite,” burns said. “if you look at either natural or synthetic graphite, there’s only a handful of companies talking about trying to build here in north america.” there will be more than 1 million tons/year of graphite demand by 2030 in north america alone, he said. meanwhile, “china controls the market,” burns said. “they can control or throttle the growth outside of the asian market if they control the upstream material,” he added. a man works in a workshop of a graphite company in jixi city, northeast china's heilongjiang ...

(photo by zhang tao/xinhua via getty images) on october 19, china’s ministry of commerce announced new export controls on battery grade graphite. beginning december 1, u.s. companies will be required to apply for permits to receive synthetic and natural graphite from china, which has two-thirds of the world’s natural graphite supply. u.s. companies already have the section 301 tariff, a 25% tariff on incoming graphite from china, which will review the waiver extension in december. novonix will produce synthetic graphite globally. for its tennessee plant, novonix will reconstruct petroleum coke from its largest shareholder, phillips 66, into battery ready powder for cell manufacturers including lg energy solution, panasonic, and samsung sdi. “when we buy petroleum-based coke products, we are almost upcycling those products into a cleaner ecosystem. if those were not distilled all the way down to the coking level, they would likely be sold off as fuel grade cokes or bunker oil for electricity,” burns said. novonix said it could eventually move to alternative feedstock, such as solid carbon from pyrolysis or biomass to lower cost or carbon intensity of graphite, as a feedstock. “the conversation is inherently complex. would it be cleaner to go through pyrolysis to get that solid carbon, i assume the net result of the answer would be yes,” he said. a slim but expanding market fewer than a dozen small companies around the world are testing methane pyrolysis to produce turquoise hydrogen, but they have attracted millions of dollars from dozens of energy companies, including some majors, over the past two years. the global hydrogen market is valued at about $170 billion this year, but it’s expected to expand to more than $300 billion by 2030 according to grandview research. the $15 million turquoise hydrogen market alone is expected to grow to $144 billion by 2030 when many energy companies and government have pledged to go net-zero or meet global climate goals. there’s only one commercial pyrolysis plant in the u.s., monolith nebraska llc’s olive creek facility in hallam, nebraska. doe guaranteed about $1 billion in loans for the facility which produces and sells hydrogen to make ammonia for agriculture. u.s. tire giants michelin and goodyear buy the carbon black byproduct. santa monica, california-based c-zero plans to be next and more efficient. “what’s unique with our approach is not using large quantities of electricity, and we produce a little bit of water,” said zach jones, c-zero’s chief executive and cofounder. blue and green hydrogen require water for production and green requires more energy to split the molecule. “thermodynamically it takes seven and a half times less energy to pull hydrogen off of carbon than it does to pull hydrogen off of oxygen,” jones said. “we consume some of the product hydrogen we produce to drive the reaction forward so the only energy source you need to deploy our technology is natural gas, either a pipeline or a tanker full of lng off the coast of korea or japan.” c-zero is focused on korea, japan, southeast asia, but also higher latitudes in north america and europe. “if it doesn’t work in asia, it isn’t going to work anywhere. they don’t have anywhere to sequester co2. the renewable capacity factor is not very good, and they have a strong societal will to pay a premium to decarbonize. that’s going to be the initial market for this,” jones said. since launching in 2018, c-zero has attracted investment from breakthrough energy ventures, eni next, mitsubishi heavy industries, ap ventures, sk gas, engie new ventures, and trafigura. doe’s office of energy efficiency and renewable energy’s hydrogen and fuel cell technologies office awarded c-zero $1 million in january 2020. while the company’s pilot will be fully commissioned by the first quarter of 2024 and run through the year, jones said he should also know where the company plans to put its first commercial pyrolysis facility by the second quarter of 2024. he said he’d like to sell the commercial operation to “any entity that is involved in the natural gas value chain, producer, distributor, consumer with a big balance sheet and a history of developing chemical processes, a company who can help with engineering and scaleup.” there are still hurdles to pyrolysis. “the challenge that any methane pyrolysis process has is you’re throwing away half the energy in the natural gas in the form of solid carbon,” jones said. translation: it takes twice as much natural gas to produce the same amount of energy. “if you have really dirty upstream methane emissions and you’re running those into a process where you need twice as much natural gas, those upstream methane emissions can bite you twice, whereas they only bite blue hydrogen once,” jones said. jones said his hope is that natural gas is going to be cleaned up from an upstream methane emission perspective. “it’s not a glamourous process. you’re still connected to fossil fuels. you’ve got giant piles of carbon you have to put back in the ground. you’re throwing away half the energy of natural gas, so it doesn’t really fit into anybody’s sweet spot. it doesn’t look great from a pr perspective,” jones said. it’s why start-up technology companies rather than oil and gas majors are driving pyrolysis, he said. “we feel like we’re in the right place at the right time with the right idea,” jones said. american petroleum institute’s vice president of natural gas markets, rob jennings, said “approximately 30 api member companies have invested in hydrogen technologies along the whole value chain.” those who are involved in pyrolysis are largely keeping a low profile. some oil and gas majors are testing the commercial viability of methane pyrolysis and plan to unveil results within a year, according to several sources familiar with those projects. beyond that, crickets. “monetizing carbon for u.s. majors, that’s never going to become part of their core business,” ashcroft said. “i don’t expect the exxonmobils of the world to go into the synthetic graphite refining industry, but they will make a handsome amount of money from selling this feedstock.” hydrogen + evs = biden’s energy policy while hydrogen production and electric vehicle expansion are central to president biden’s energy policy, the administration, which is infusing billions of dollars into both, is not linking the two. us president joe biden drives the new electric ford f-150 lightning at the ford dearborn development ...

plan upon the implementation of the new mining code, which the government indicates is imminent. lion has prepared such data and information to meet any further request from the ministry. the company is taking all necessary steps to bring the project back into production. chairman jason walsh commented “we are very pleased that the signature of the new mining code accelerates the timeline for us to be able to restart graphite production at our ambato-arana project.” about ambato-arana graphite mine, madagascarthe 3 forty-year renewable mining exploitation licenses that comprise the project total 4,375 hectares (10,811 acres) are located in the vicinity of andasibe in toamasina province in madagascar, 20 km to the southwest of sheritt’s large-scale nickel/cobalt laterite open pit mine at ambatovy and 15 km northeast of the town of moramanga from which national highway rn2 connects with capital city antananarivo (114 km) and madagascar’s main port of toamisina (tamatave) (240 km). graphite was produced on the licenses, at a modest rate constrained by the technology employed on the licenses at that time, for roughly a century from 1910.  production was suspended by the previous owners due to a slump at the time in global graphite markets and with the deposits only partially mined. the deposits are now ready for larger scale exploitation with modern production techniques. they lie within the graphitic horizons of the highly prospective manampotsy formation and are associated with topographic highs that are exploited via free digging of lateritic ore and open pit mining, providing a lower cost exploitation without need for blasting. the graphite mineralization on the project appears within well-defined north-south belts with interbedded graphite-rich friable layers. the geological layers of interest have continuity of several kilometres and exhibit a shallow dip angle. sample data indicate good grade (up to 10% carbon content with some samples up to nearly 14%) and large flake (jumbo size) consistent with other nearby mines e.g. gallois (elate graphite), sahamamy & vatomina (tirupati graphite) and dni metals’ vohitsara (dni metals). further

christmas cards, the latest we suggest ordering is early november. that may seem a bit extreme, but shipping can take anywhere from one to three weeks depending on the retailer, and it’s best to build in a few extra days since the holiday season often causes slower-than-average mail times. most folks ship out their christmas cards after thanksgiving, so in order to get your cards to your loved ones ahead of the holiday craze, it’s best time have them on hand by late november.",Positive

""for the most part, protected area identification and conservation planning is geared towards the needs of mammals and birds. amphibians are falling through the cracks,"" said conservationist jennifer luedtke of the texas-based global nonprofit re:wild, co-coordinator of the iucn amphibian specialist group's red list authority and lead author of the study published in the journal nature. amphibians first appeared more than 300 million years ago. three orders of amphibians exist today: salamanders and newts (60 per cent threatened with extinction); frogs and toads (39 per cent); and the limbless and serpentine caecilians (16 per cent). since 2004, 306 species have crept closer to extinction, the study found. ""what is needed now is a global movement to catalyse the recovery of the world's amphibians,"" re:wild conservationist and study co-author kelsey neam said. the researchers identified four amphibian species - a frog from australia, a frog from guatemala, a salamander from guatemala and a toad from costa rica - that have disappeared since 2004. they also listed 185 species as ""possibly extinct,"" with no known surviving population. habitat destruction and degradation, caused mostly by animal agriculture and crops, remained the most common danger, affecting 93 per cent of the threatened amphibian species. but a growing proportion of species was being imperilled by disease and climate change, the researchers found. ""amphibians are particularly sensitive to changes in their environment, in part because they breathe through their skin,"" neam said. ""so the effects of climate change - increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, changes in moisture and temperature, sea-level rise and fires - can result in the loss of key breeding sites, increased mortality, habitat degradation, and habitat shifts that make it harder for amphibians to find suitable places to live,"" neam added. while an amphibian pandemic involving a fungal pathogen that causes the disease chytridiomycosis has waned, there is fresh concern that another fungal pathogen seen in asia and europe may enter the americas. the study also cited ongoing threats from the animal trade and human hunting for food. the heaviest concentrations of threatened amphibians were found to be in the caribbean islands, mexico and central america, the tropical andes region, india, sri lanka, cameroon, nigeria and madagascar. ""amphibians have evolved into an incredible diversity of sizes, colors and behaviors. they can be as tiny as a common housefly - macaya breast-spot frog - and as long as a cow - chinese giant salamander,"" neam said. ""amphibians are our allies in understanding the health of our planet,"" luedtke said. ""when we protect and recover amphibians, we protect and restore terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, we safeguard the genetic diversity of our planet, and we invest in a future in which all life - including human life - thrives.""",Negative

""tirupati expects the combination of increasing demand and supply shortfalls, alongside china's export restrictions, to have a positive impact on graphite prices which have fallen since the start of 2023. tirupati also expects that ex-china consumers of flake graphite in energy transition sectors and others shall progress their efforts to secure ex-china supply sources for their flake graphite needs to mitigate increasing geopolitical risk surrounding it and other critical minerals.""  china on friday announced new curbs on exports of certain types of graphite, key to making batteries for electric vehicles, days after the us slapped fresh restrictions on outflows of high-tech microchips, afp reported.  china was the world's leading graphite producer last year, accounting for an estimated 65% of total production, according to the us geological survey.  tirupati said: ""the company is one of very few current producers outside china, and one of only two quoted companies outside china that has brought globally significant new flake graphite production capacity into commercial production in the past decade, and at industry leading capital intensity levels.  it said the developments in china reinforced the company's strategy. the firm has operations in madagascar and projects in mozambique, the largest producers of graphite outside of china. together, the two african nations, separated by the mozambique channel, represent around 15% of current global flake graphite production, tirupati said.  executive chair shishir poddar said: ""the implications of china's export restrictions are positive for tirupati both in terms of the likely impact on prices, and on the long-term demand for our product given our position as one of the few graphite producers outside of china.""  by eric cunha, alliance news news editor  comments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com  copyright 2023 alliance news ltd. all rights reserved.",Neutral

""it's good to be pain free after all this while,'' tafita told toi. he has to undergo rigourous physical rehabilitation for six to 12 months.after examining tafita for the first time in july, a tumor board headed by dr gundavda and having doctors from neurosurgery and surgery departments, decided to opt for three eight-hour surgeries spread over five days. ""in the first surgery, we focused on the anterior stage for separation of vital organs and vessels, and doctors from various oncosurgery specialties such as urology and vascular surgery were a part of it,"" said the doctor. the posterior side was handled during the second stage of surgery. here, the tumor was removed and reconstruction using metallic rods and screws were done in a third session. the patient needed 30 units of blood or blood products during the span of surgery over five days in july. he stayed thereafter for rehabilitation before leaving for home a few weeks back.kokilaben dhirubhai ambani hospital ceo dr santosh shetty, ""our hospital follows a full-timer system with our doctors present throughout the day for our patients. this made such a critical surgery possible for us,"" he said. dr gundavda added that the complex orthopedic oncology procedure would not have been possible without surgeons from other specialities.as for tafita, he is now back home and focused on rehabilitation. it was in 2017, just after he finished high school and was in the first year of university studying finance, that he felt the pain for the first time . he underwent a biopsy in 2017 itself, but didn’t follow up due to financial constraints. as he was soon unable to move, he completed his studies online and managed to get a remote job in a trading company. when his brother learnt about the government schemes to finance complicated surgery/treatment, he looked for options and reached out to doctors in the andheri hospital. ""post-surgery, tafita’s condition is able to move/ lift his back and needs no support in doing so. he has gradually started to feel better and he is relieved of excruciating pain,"" said dr gundavda. although the impact of his condition has left no sensation in the lower part of his body, he is able to move now with the help of a walker and wheelchair.",Neutral

type (primary and secondary), by demand, by application (batteries and non-batteries), by region size and trends with impact of covid-19 and forecast up to 2028""report has been added toresearchandmarkets.com'soffering.the global cobalt market was valued at us$9.48 billion in 2022. the market value is expected to reach us$17.68 billion by 2028. the global cobalt market mined supply stood at 205.30 kilotonnes in 2022. whereas, the cobalt market demand is projected to rise to 267.33 kilotonnes by 2028. cobalt is a hard ferromagnetic, silver-white, hard, lustrous, brittle element. it is a member of group viii of the periodic table. cobalt is an important raw material for the production of battery materials, superalloys, high-temperature alloys, cutting tools, magnetic materials, petrochemical catalysts, pharmaceuticals, and glaze materials. owing to the benefits provided by the cobalt and the wide applications it serves, the cobalt market has been growing in the past few years. moreover, there are several new cobalt projects in development, which are expected to increase the supply of cobalt in the coming years. these projects are located in countries such as australia, the democratic republic of the congo (drc), and morocco. this would help to meet the growing demand for cobalt and stabilize the price of cobalt, resulting in market growth. the cobalt market is expected to grow at a cagr of approx. 11.0% over the projected period of 2023-2028. market segmentation analysis: the chemical segment takes the lead in market share and is projected to experience the most rapid growth in the forecasted period. this is attributed to the magnetic properties of metallic cobalt, which make it invaluable for crafting high-performance magnets used in electric motors, generators, and various other devices. the escalating use of electric motors and related devices has consequently driven up the demand for metallic cobalt, propelling market expansion. in 2022, the surge in cobalt production was driven by significant increases in the democratic republic of congo, which accounts for approximately 70% of global supply, as well as indonesia, an emerging player in this rapidly growing market. mine production is poised for continuous growth in the coming years, primarily due to further increases in production from congo and indonesia. as various industries, including electronics, renewable energy, and transportation, experience growth and demand for products containing cobalt, producers are intensifying their cobalt refining operations to meet this heightened demand. simultaneously, improved recycling technologies and growing awareness of resource sustainability are anticipated to boost the recycling of cobalt-containing materials, contributing to an increased refined supply in the years ahead. while cobalt is present in most portable devices used in daily life, electric vehicles (evs) surpassed electronics as the major source of demand in 2022. the combination of ev purchase subsidies, part of post-covid economic stimulus packages in the eu and china, and the pandemic-induced shift in consumer spending patterns significantly accelerated demand for cobalt in evs in 2020 and 2021. geographically, asia, particularly china, japan, and south korea, dominates as the largest cobalt-consuming region, reflecting the concentration of battery materials production in asia. the battery segment claims the largest share of the market and is forecasted to be the fastest-growing segment in the foreseeable future. this segment is further categorized into electric vehicles, electronics, energy storage systems (ess), and power devices & motive products. countries such as the eu, the us, japan, and china have consistently raised standards for vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions over the past 15 years, incentivizing automotive manufacturers to develop electric alternatives to traditional internal combustion engine designs. consumer preferences are increasingly shifting toward more environmentally friendly vehicles, leading to a rise in ev sales, thereby supporting cobalt market growth. the report offers insights into the cobalt market's mined supply based on regions, including congo (drc), indonesia, russia, australia, canada, cuba, madagascar, and the rest of the world. drc currently holds the largest market share, while indonesia is poised to be the fastest-growing region in the coming years. efforts to regulate and legitimize the artisanal and small-scale mining (asm) sector in the drc, including the establishment of a state-owned company to purchase and market all asm cobalt, as well as industry-driven responsible sourcing initiatives, are expected to enhance transparency and ethical sourcing practices in the cobalt supply chain. this will further bolster the cobalt market's growth in the drc in the coming years. indonesia's increased cobalt production is primarily attributed to four new high-pressure acid leaching (hpal) facilities that process ore to produce both nickel and cobalt in mixed hydroxide precipitate, which can then be exported. more such facilities are in development, including the us$2.6 billion sonic bay nickel-cobalt hydrometallurgical complex, a joint venture between eramet and basf. consequently, the indonesian region presents lucrative growth opportunities for the cobalt market in the foreseeable future. competitive landscape: in 2022, glencore produced 43.80 kilotonnes of cobalt. also, in 2022, glencore and general motors co. announced a multi-year sourcing agreement in which glencore would supply gm with cobalt from the company's murrin murrin operation in australia. global market analysis competitive analysis global

exports of key battery mineral graphite on friday, miners
elsewhere face a race against time to bring new projects to
fruition to secure supplies for the next generation of electric
vehicles. china will require export permits for some graphite products
to protect national security, its commerce ministry said, in its
latest move to safeguard supplies of critical minerals and
protect its manufacturing dominance. the world's top graphite producer and exporter also refines
more than 90% of the material used in virtually all electric
vehicles' (evs) battery anodes, which is the negatively charged
portion of a battery. the next generation of evs is due to hit around 2025 and
several carmakers have sought help plugging gaps in supply after
years of pandemic-related parts shortages highlighted the risks
of over-reliance on one country. to stay ahead in a fast-changing industry, carmakers have
been investing directly in mining projects to ensure future
supplies of the battery inputs. but building mines takes between five and 10 years, meaning
china will keep its lead in supplying graphite for at least half
a decade, miners in other countries say, as those projects are
mostly still in pre-production. ""what china is saying to the west with this decision is that
we are not going to help you make electric cars, you have to
find your own way to do that,"" northern graphite ceo
hugues jacquemin said. china's move took multiple sectors by surprise, with some
end-users fearing more curbs could follow. ""we see china's move as a potential catalyst to highlight
the urgency of improving domestic graphite supply,"" said john
demaio, president of graphex's graphene division. ""we've aligned ourselves with several graphite miners
outside of china. i would imagine this news will accelerate
their plans to bring capacity online in the near term,"" demaio
said. graphex group plans to open a graphite processing
facility in warren, michigan, by the end of 2024 that aims to
supply u.s. automakers with at least 10,000 metric tons per year
of the key metal, the largest component in an ev battery. commodity producing and consuming giant china dominates
other critical minerals including forms of refined cobalt,
nickel and manganese as well as rare earths, a group of 17
elements used in products from lasers and military equipment to
magnets found in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and consumer
electronics such as iphones. ""the battery controls a lot of the cost of a vehicle, so if
carmakers outside of china are forced to use very expensive
materials or can't access them,...that is going to ramp up their
prices or force them to purchase the batteries from chinese
battery manufacturers,"" said stefan bernstein, ceo of greenroc
mining, owner of a graphite project in greenland that
is due to reach production in 2027. northern graphite's jacquemin said the company had been
getting calls from oems (original equipment manufacturers) on
what impact china's latest move would have, concerned about
supply security for batteries and other electronics equipment. he said china's move meant northern graphite could
encourage investors to raise money to hit production by 2027. shishir poddar, executive chairman of tirupati graphite
, which has mining and processing operations in
madagascar and recently acquired two projects in mozambique,
said the import curbs will ""further boost the development of
ex-china graphite activities"".   (reporting by nelson banya, clara denina, divya rajagopal,

planned, from continuous operations to campaign processing to ensure optimum product recoveries are maintained, with extended shuts between campaigns to allow hmc stocks to rebuild.the combination of lower hmc production and msp shuts reduced the hmc fed to the msp in the quarter to 71.6kt (last quarter: 106.1kt), resulting in a corresponding fall in production for all products.  deposition of sand tails into the mined out north dune pit p199 commenced in the quarter, with sand tails also continuing to be deposited on the mined-out central dune area.to aid water retention and subsequent rehabilitation, the sand tails are capped with a co-disposed slimes/sand layer.rehabilitation activities on the central dune, south dune and north dune proceeded to plan.  summary by quarter fy23 fy24

dispatched (last quarter: 89.5kt).containerised shipments of rutile and zircon through the mombasa port also proceeded to plan.despite lower production levels for the remainder of kwale operations’ mine life, the company plans to continue bulk shipments of ilmenite (up to 54kt lots) and rutile (between 5-10kt lots), which will result in greater volatility in quarterly sales volumes, as illustrated by the sales volumes for this quarter.  unit operating costs have increased tous$343per tonne produced (rutile, ilmenite, zircon and low-grade products) (last quarter:us$240per tonne) due

production guidance – kwale operations”, for the assumptions upon which the guidance is based.] market conditions became increasingly challenging through the september quarter due to growing economic uncertainty and softening property sectors across all key markets.however, firm demand continued for base resources’ products through the quarter and sales were in line with expectations.prices held up well for ilmenite and rutile, but zircon prices moderated due to the sluggish conditions that emerged during the latter part of the june quarter.  ilmenite demand and prices inchinaremained relatively stable through the quarter as major chinese pigment plants maintained high levels of production.the domestic pigment market inchinawas subdued through most of the quarter but saw a seasonal improvement towards the end of the quarter.export opportunities for chinese pigment producers increased through the quarter as significant pigment production capacity intaiwanandeuropewas closed.chloride pigment producers inchina, which are reliant on imported ilmenite, continued to build and ramp up new production capacity which supported demand for base resources’ ilmenite.  major western pigment producers have continued to sacrifice sales volumes to support stable prices and, as a result, production rates were well below capacity levels to avoid a build-up of inventory and demand for high-grade titanium dioxide feedstocks was consequently reduced.while one major high-grade feedstock producer has suspended production of synthetic rutile for at least four months, which will assist in offsetting the drop in demand, downward pressure on rutile prices is expected to continue building.  rutile demand from the smaller welding and titanium metal sectors remained firm in the quarter.sales into these sectors command a significant price premium over bulk rutile for the tio2 pigment market, but this premium is expected to reduce as some high-grade feedstock supply to the pigment sector is re-directed to these sectors.base resources is maintaining its approach of increasing the proportion of its rutile sales to the welding sector.  the weakening conditions in the chinese and european zircon markets towards the end of the june quarter led to a reduction in contracted zircon prices for september quarter.global demand for zircon has continued to soften through the quarter and prices will moderate further for december quarter contracts. health and safety  there were no lost time injuries during the quarter and, with no lost time injuries in the past 12 months, base resources has a lost time injury frequency rate (ltifr) of 0.0 per million hours worked.compared to the western australian all mines 2020/2021 ltifr of 2.0, this is an exceptional performance and reflects the ongoing focus and importance placed on safety.with no medical treatment injuries recorded in the last 12 months, base resources’ total recordable injury frequency rate is 0.0per million hours worked.  community and environment – kwale operations  farmers participating in the company’s agricultural livelihood programs in kwale county, implemented through the pavi farmers’ cooperative, commenced harvesting of cotton and maize crops towards the end of the quarter and are also commencing preparations for what is expected to be a successful growing season, with above average rainfall forecast for the december quarter’s ‘small rains’ as an el nino weather pattern develops.  training on business, entrepreneurship and leadership was delivered to 21 women’s groups during the quarter, with the approximately 350 participants also receiving support from the company for various income generating initiatives.  the ‘long rains’, which normally run april to june, extended well into the september quarter allowing a further 30,000 trees to be planted as part of the company’s rehabilitation efforts, bringing the total planted for the rainy season to 80,000trees.no instances of environmental non-compliance, major environmental incidents or environment-related community complaints were identified or recorded during the quarter.  community and environment – toliara project  all community training programs and social infrastructure projects remain on hold while the toliara project’s on-ground activities are suspended. toliara project development –madagascar engagement with the government ofmadagascaron toliara project fiscal terms and lifting of the project’s on-ground suspension has been limited during the quarter, principally due to the government focus on preparations for the upcoming presidential elections. the new mining code was recently passed into law and now applies to the company’s toliara project.  key financial elements of the new mining code relevant to the toliara project are:  the application of the above elements, and several other key provisions of the new mining code, lack sufficient detail to fully assess their potential impact on the toliara project.other provisions that may impact the project include any prescribed specifications (conditions) attaching to the project’s exploitation permit 37242, minimum requirements for the project’s corporate social responsibility plan (which will include social investment, infrastructure spending and local content requirements), prescribed annual mining fees and requirements for an environmental and rehabilitation provision.  the government is preparing the implementing decree for the new mining code, a draft of which should shortly be available for industry consultation.greater clarity on the new mining code and its application to the toliara project is expected once the implementing decree is finalised together with any further supporting regulations, orders and decrees.  separately, the first round of the presidential elections have been deferred by a week to16 november 2023, with the second round (if needed) scheduled for 20december 2023.the incumbent president has declared his candidacy and officially resigned on9 september 2023to commence campaigning.  until the full suite of mining code reform is completed and elections finalised, the company does not expect to achieve material progress in securing fiscal terms or lifting of the project’s on-ground suspension.the company remains ready and committed to progressing the world class toliara project to a final investment decision once fiscal terms are secured and the on-ground suspension is lifted.  the toliara rare earths pre-feasibility study of the economic potential of the monazite contained in the toliara project’s ranobe mineral resources estimate continued in the quarter and remains on track for completion in the march quarter of 2024.  total expenditure on the toliara project and toliara rare earths pre-feasibility study for the quarter wasus$2.4 million(last quarter:us$2.0 million).

future of kenya's garment trade, which has employed her for 13
years and helped her put six children through school and
university, lies in the hands of the u.s. congress. and like others, she is worried. u.s. officials visiting south africa this week to meet
african trade ministers will face calls to reauthorise the
african growth and opportunity act (agoa) which expires in 2025. despite longstanding bipartisan support from lawmakers, who
view washington's flagship african trade initiative as critical
to taking on china, deep dysfunction on capitol hill and
divisions over the need for updates have raised doubts. apparel companies and industry insiders warn that africa
risks a once-in-a-generation shift away from chinese
manufacturing passing it by, with an estimated 240,000 to
290,000 jobs such as nasimiyu's under threat. ""we are praying that they extend,"" the single mother said
during a break from stitching levi's jeans at a nairobi factory.
""it is very hard to get a job here in kenya."" apparel has been the standout success story of agoa, which
launched in 2000 to help develop african economies and foster
democracy. african apparel exports under the programme reached nearly
$1.4 billion last year, double the amount pre-agoa. pankaj bedi, chairman of ual and norah nasimiyu's employer,
said agoa's duty free access to the world's biggest consumer
market is the reason his company - kenya's largest garment
producer - exists. ""almost 100% of what we are exporting goes to the u.s.""  bypassing africa industry insiders and policymakers see a chance to build on
that success as companies reduce their dependence on china in
the wake of the pandemic and subsequent supply chain headaches. ""we've been struck by how open the opportunity is now for
us,"" south african trade minister ebrahim patel said last week. nearly 80% of companies polled in a july survey by the
united states fashion industry association (usfia) planned to
reduce chinese sourcing over the next two years. ""many of them talk about africa,"" said stephen lamar, ceo of
the american apparel and footwear association. capturing even a fraction of that business could prove
transformative for africa. but companies need clarity, he said,
adding: ""if it is not renewed until two years from now, these
current investment decisions are going to bypass africa"". that lack of clarity is not only hitting new investments. the usfia survey found that 45% of respondents had already
reduced sourcing from agoa countries over renewal uncertainty,
while another 45% plan to cut sourcing from the continent if
there is no reauthorisation by june 2024.  'collapse' african governments are pushing for a similar
reauthorisation to the 10-year agoa extension approved by
congress in 2015 with bipartisan support, ideally before an
expected u.s. election year pause on new trade legislation. but that is looking increasingly unlikely. ""there's a high level of uncertainty about what happens and
the context keeps shifting,"" said michael walsh, a senior fellow
at the philadelphia-based foreign policy research institute. amid deepening global polarisation, moscow, beijing and the
west are all leveraging trade and economic ties as they step up
efforts to court african governments. more than a dozen u.s. senators are pushing for a quick agoa
renewal arguing the need to ""counter the malign influence of
china, russia, and other foreign actors"". but the house of representatives, paralysed for weeks by
factional fighting over its speakership, faces a daunting list
of must-pass legislation. and there is another obstacle to a quick reauthorisation,
namely a well-intentioned desire to improve agoa. the u.s. international trade commission (usitc) in a report
earlier this year highlighted major shortcomings. more than 80% of duty-free non-petroleum agoa exports, for
example, came from south africa, kenya, lesotho, madagascar and
ethiopia. ""some countries have benefited greatly from agoa, but the
majority have not,"" constance hamilton, the biden
administration's top trade official for africa, said last week,
calling for congress to consider changes that would ""make the
programme more impactful"". such talk worries apparel company executives, who point to
the troubled fate of the generalized system of preferences (gsp)
- the largest and oldest u.s. trade preference programme. congress failed to renew gsp before it expired at the end of
2020 and its reauthorisation remains bogged down in gridlock
between the house and senate over eligibility requirement
changes. attempts to change agoa risk creating a similar impasse,
said greg poole, senior advisor for global sourcing at clothing
company the children's place. ""if we try to radically change agoa, it's going to get
stalled out. and if it gets stalled out, it's going to follow
the path of gsp,"" he said. there is little doubt what would happen in agoa's absence. the usitc report said agoa benefits ""appear to be essential
for ... countries to maintain their apparel exports to the
united states"". it pointed to a temporary suspension of madagascar's agoa
benefits in 2009, which cost it 50,000 to 100,000 jobs, while
ethiopia lost 100,000 jobs when it was suspended last year. in kenya, ual chairman bedi remains hopeful, but knows how
things will play out if agoa evaporates. ""all the companies which are here will be gone for sure,
including mine ... the industry will collapse."" (reporting by joe bavier in johannesburg and duncan miriri in

""how do we build trust? we build trust through dialogues such as the gmc, joint exercises, industrial collaboration, sharing of resources, respecting international law etc,"" singh said, adding that the trust amongst cooperating countries will lead to optimal outcomes in common maritime priorities.  ""since our countries interact with each other on a multitude of issues. it is possible to build trust by discussion and consultation with each other,"" the defence minister said.  quoting the sanskrit adage 'sanghe shakti kaliyuge', singh said in the present era, strength lies in collaboration and cooperation, and cooperative equilibrium can also be achieved in international relations.  ""in our context, common maritime priorities such as tackling climate change, controlling piracy, terrorism, drug trafficking and overfishing at the high seas need to be addressed by all of us cooperatively.  ""if the threats that we face are supranational in scope and impact, international efforts to address them will indeed have limited effects,"" the defence minister said, adding that regional challenges can be managed through multinational collaborative mitigation frameworks.  illegal, unreported and unregulated (iuu) fishing is a challenge related to over-exploitation of resources in the region, singh said.  iuu fishing  threatens the ecosystem, economic security and regional and global food security, he said, adding that it is a common maritime priority to control iuu fishing.  multinational collaboration efforts for the compilation, coalition and sharing of surveillance data was the need of the hour, he said.

and a sign of tensions in the indian ocean region, say analysts. the maldives has a population of half a million people scattered across more than 1,000 islands. but last weekend, the picturesque archipelago delivered an electoral verdict that has sent shock waves around the world — and especially across the indian ocean region. mohamed muizzu, the opposition candidate, emerged victorious in the presidential run-off on saturday andsecured54 percent of the vote, results released by the electoral commission showed. muizzu, who backs closer ties between the maldives and china, defeated the incumbent president ibrahim mohamed solih, who is widely perceived as pro-india. “with today’s result, we have got the opportunity to build the country’s future,” muizzu said in a statement after his victory. “the strength to ensure the freedom of maldives.” the vote transformed into a de facto referendum over the country’s ties with india and china. india has 75 military personnel stationed in the maldives. new delhi says they are there to maintain and operate two helicopters and an aircraft it donated to the country. throughout his election campaign, muizzu pledged to remove those troops from the maldives. “seen from the zero-sum lens that often drives great power competition, beijing is a big winner from this election,” michael kugelman, south asia director at the wilson center, a washington-based think-tank, told al jazeera. “muizzu’s campaign plank was not only about strengthening ties with beijing, it was also about aiming to undermine india by calling for an end to any indian military presence in maldives. this is music to the ears of beijing,” he added. to be sure, india will look to retain as much of its influence in the maldives as it can, say analysts. following the announcement of muizzu’s victory, indian prime minister narendra modi sent his congratulations to the president-elect. “india remains committed to strengthening the time-tested india-maldives bilateral relationship and enhancing our overall cooperation in the indian ocean region,” modi said on x, formerly known as twitter.      new delhi has enjoyed cosy ties with male under president solih, who took office following a landslide victory in 2018 against muizzu’s mentor, former president abdulla yameen. india poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the tourist hot spot. new delhi also financed infrastructure projects, both big and small, in the country. “india will support the new democratically elected government and will seek to work closely with it,” shantanu roy-chaudhury, author of the china factor: beijing’s expanding engagement in sri lanka, maldives, bangladesh, and myanmar, told al jazeera. the modi government, he said, is “likely to continue its pursuit of the greater male connectivity projects” — a 6.7km (4-mile) road project currently under construction that aims to link the capital, male, with the island of villingili. india has given the maldives a $100m grant and a $400m line of credit for the infrastructure initiative. but the road ahead won’t be easy for new delhi, said roy-chaudhury. “given the new government’s pro-china outlook, the future of indian influence and development projects hangs in the balance,” he said. muizzu, a 45-year-old civil engineer by training, has taken aim at the imbalanced trade relationship between the maldives and india, promising to fix it. but while trade between the south asian neighbours is heavily skewed towards india — as is often the case between a giant economy and a smaller one — the maldives fares little better when it comes to china. india’s exports to the maldives amounted to$416m in 2021, while it imported $49m from the smaller nation. china, meanwhile, exported goods worth$395mto the maldives, and its imports were valued at $3.9m. muizzu emerged as an unexpected candidate to lead the progressive party of maldives (ppm), after serving as the construction minister in the administration of yameen. a path to the country’s top seat opened up for him after yameen, also a pro-china leader, was put behind bars on corruption charges. under yameen, the maldives obtained more than $1bn in loans from china to finance huge infrastructure projects, including housing for residents of land-scarce male and a first-of-its-kind bridge connecting the congested capital to nearby suburb and airport islands.      analysts say the change of guard in male could present an opportunity for not just beijing but also chinese investors. “beijing will certainly try to move in, though i wouldn’t overstate the impact of the election on its investment patterns,” kugelman said. “even in the era of solih, who was pro-india but not hostile to china, we saw some continued chinese commercial collaborations with the maldives – not on the level we saw during the yameen era, but still substantive activity. certainly, though, muizzi’s victory will be empowering, for chinese investors as well as chinese grand strategists and diplomats.” kugelman said the election results might be a “body blow” to india, both diplomatically and geopolitically, but new delhi will not throw in the towel. “by no means is new delhi planning to raise the red flag and effectively cede the maldives to china. that would fly in the face of its intense competition with beijing,” he said. “new delhi will remain confident it can continue to have some degree of partnership with male.” as muizzu prepares to take office on november 17, roy-chaudhury said the new leader of the maldives might not be able to abandon new delhi completely and pivot towards beijing even if he wanted to. india, he said, would continue to emphasise its developmental aid and seek to build on it. “india and the maldives both need each other.”          follow al jazeera english:",Neutral

search data for 119 bucket list places to visit in 219 countries. the results paint a vivid picture of travel aspirations, spanning from the breathtaking shores of the maldives to the thundering majesty of niagara falls, encompassing iconic landmarks and awe-inspiring natural wonders along the way. according to sheena paton, senior program manager, this is the first time kuoni has assembled this travel bucket list . “we’ve previously created travel stories that have analyzed the demand for different locations or the best landmarks to visit, but this unique study looks at every country's most popular bucket list item,” paton told me in an interview. “we were intrigued to see how this might vary from country to country and which experiences would come out on top, so we decided to do this study to reveal what travelers around the world want to experience.” aerial view of canareef resort in the maldives, named the top bucket list trip in a new report. coming in at the top of the world’s best bucket list destinations is the idyllic cluster of islands known as the maldives—which is known for its stunning white sands, bright blue waters and incredible sunsets. it topped the travel bucket list for 121 countries. “it’s great to see that a trip to the maldives is considered a bucket list item for so many people,” says paton. “it’s a tropical paradise popular amongst honeymooners, families and retirees alike.” coincidentally, in 2021 kuoni looked at where the world wants to travel most. “the top destinations to travel to that year were the maldives, mexico and bali, which is interesting because visiting the maldives also came top as the most searched-for travel bucket list experience in this most recent report,” paton explains. in second place on the global travel bucket list: niagara falls, which receives an impressive amount of searches each year, as people hope to get up close to the incredible waterfalls located on the canadian and american border.

""we want to push this research area into a better place, not just within the field itself, but also in terms of public trust in science as a whole.""highlighting biases in the fieldkey study topics identified wereclimate changeand coral resilience, at 50% and 42%, respectively. bioerosion of corals—the removal of coral material by other living reef organisms—was the least studied.""through this analysis, we have revealed key gaps in coral health topics for further review, particularly when considering conservation policy,"" says burke. ""bio-erosion and the coral microbiome—the bacteria that lives in its tissues—are not fully understood yet. these two facets, particularly the coral microbiome, could drastically change our understanding of how coral health is affected by climate change and human activities.""while their analysis found that the authors of these papers are highly interconnected, they discovered that authors from countries such as maldives and papua new guinea, are not as represented within the literature as they should be for the amount of coral reefs within those ocean territories.this bias, referred to as academic colonialism, omits the knowledge base of the researchers who live and breathe the threats to and benefits of these major coral reef systems. the team warn that this could leave certain threats unaddressed and certain reefs unprotected from the stressors that lead to reef decline.""so, for example, as we had seen that most of the researchers are coming from america, it might explain why we have so much research on coral bleaching, because there have been lots of coral bleaching events that have been well documented in the caribbean and hawaii, compared to events that are happening in other coral reefs, for example, disease outbreaks in the coral sea, right off the coast of indonesia.""additionally, using citation information and alternative metrics of impact, the data also provide a sense of the reach of the research within and outside of academia, for example, whether work has been used in policymaking or conservation practices.the team found that more than 80% of papers stated that the review's primary purpose was to inform coral conservation. however, data the team collected from a citation repository also revealed that the reviews were only cited in policy 0.565 times, on average.""we were surprised to find that very little of the research was actually reaching outside of academia. incorporating research in policy could be improved through greater research accessibility and continuing to gather public interest in coral reefs.""increasing public trust in sciencethe researchers hope that in being transparent about the current research landscape, they can encourage higher standards of research integrity. ""identifying areas where we can make science more accessible to the public is definitely going to improve how we can engage with our intended audiences as researchers.""by highlighting countries with large coral reef ecosystems, such as the maldives and indonesia, which are underrepresented in the literature, burke hopes that these biases can be addressed with changes in funding.""these local researchers provide a wealth of knowledge and are intimately familiar with the community's relationship with coral reefs. when we include these researchers in studies of coral health, we tap into a great source of information and encourage a passion for coral reef conservation in the public.""importantly, the methods used in the study are very reproducible, systematic processes that scientists in other areas of research can use to conduct similar assessments in their field of interest.""these methods are relatively new to ecology, and especially new in terms of marine ecology,"" says burke. ""so, seeing these techniques get picked up in other topics could provide a better picture of what's going on in our reefs and what's going on in our oceans.""ultimately, the team hope that this research will push coral health research in a new direction—one that produces research of higher quality, collaboration, and efficiency.""as coral reefs decline, we should also aim to rebuildpublic trustin research and strengthen the evidence base for the imperative conservation of our reefs.""",Neutral

shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: foreign minister of canada's comments? vineeta pandey: yes. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: update on? vineeta pandey: she said that, you know, she is talking to india, you know, that she is engaging india in private conversation with regard to repatriation of the diplomats. so any development on that? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: what's your query? vineeta pandey: the question is that, has the talk begun? has she met, her team met the indian side on, you know, removing the 41 diplomats that are extra here? ayushi agarwal: sir, ayushi agarwal from ani. sir, my question is regarding the closure of the afghan embassy in new delhi. they recently put out a statement where they said there was a lack of support from the host government of india. so your comment on that, also, what would be the fallout of this on the afghans living in india, especially the students? john reed: john reed from the ft. is it true, as we've been told, that india has given canada a deadline of october 10th to repatriate about 41 of its diplomats? and if they were to stay beyond that date, what would india do? would they become persona non grata? and have you also identified who these people should be and told canada who they should send back? thank you. sidhant: sir, sidhant from wion. sir, what's india's view or reaction when it comes to the change of guard in maldives? we know that the elections happened and someone who's, of course, an opposition candidate won the elections. yeshi seli: so this is yeshi seli from the new indian express. a week...10 days back, the u.s. ambassador to pakistan had gone to balochistan. and eric garcetti, when we questioned him, said that if we can go to kashmir for g20, i see no harm in his going to balochistan. any comments on that? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: which part? the comment or the actual visit? both? yeshi seli: gilgit-baltistan. i'm sorry. i stand corrected. so any comments? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: comment on what? comment on visit or comment on the comment? yeshi seli: no. comment on what ambassador garcetti said that, it doesn't matter and if they can go there, they can come here. india generally does oppose, you know, dignitaries and diplomats..... shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: it's okay. i'll try to answer your question. okay. let me start. maybe actually, why don't i start yeshi with your query on the comment or the visit. let me answer both. look, i think our position on the status of the entire union territory of jammu and kashmir, that being an integral part of india, is well known. we would urge the international community to respect our sovereignty and territorial integrity. we have raised our concerns about that visit; a visit by the pakistani ambassador, i mean the u.s. ambassador to pakistan; with the u.s. side. and as regards your comment also, i think ambassador garcetti's comment, we don't think the two situations are equivalent. as regards the issue of afghan embassy, ayushi...look, on that one, our understanding is that the embassy in new delhi is functioning or continuing to function. we are in touch with the afghan diplomats who are there in that embassy, as well as with the afghan diplomats who are at the consulates in mumbai and hyderabad. however, we received a communication last week purportedly from the embassy, indicating that it intends to suspend operations at the end of september, i think it was. of course, such a decision is an internal matter of a foreign mission. however, we have noted that the afghan consulates general in mumbai and in hyderabad voiced their objection to that decision or to such a decision. we are also aware that there has been a prolonged absence of the ambassador and that a large number of afghan diplomats have left india in recent past. you asked about what would be the difficulties with the students. we would hope that a substantial or the substantial number of afghan nationals in india, including students, are able to continue to receive necessary consular support. on our part, we will continue with our efforts to assist the people of afghanistan, and i think that takes care of both your concerns that you mentioned. before i come to canada, sidhant, on the issue of maldives...look, you would have seen the developments there. prime minister was the first leader to convey greetings and felicitations to the president-elect. prime minister conveyed and reaffirmed india's commitment to strengthen the time-tested india-maldives bilateral relationship and enhancing overall cooperation in the indian ocean region. subsequently yesterday, i think, our high commissioner in male also called on the president-elect. he had a good discussion on various aspects of our bilateral partnership, including development cooperation. let me take the opportunity to congratulate the maldivian people for once again demonstrating their faith in democratic governance and constitutional processes that reflect their firm commitment to the values of democracy and the rule of law. john, your question as well as i think vineeta's question on talks, basically on canada. look, you would recall last week we had a substantial, quite lengthy conversation on canada. insofar as discussions on parity, as we have mentioned earlier, given the much higher diplomatic presence of canadian diplomats or diplomatic presence here of canada and their continuing interference in our internal affairs, we had and we have sought parity in our respective diplomatic presence. discussions are ongoing on the modalities of achieving this. specific question by you, john, regarding dates, et cetera. look, i would not like to get into the details of diplomatic conversations. as we mentioned, i think last week, given that canadian diplomatic presence is very much higher, we would assume that there would be a reduction. i think that broadly covers those issues. shashank mattoo: shashank mattoo with the mint, just to follow up on sidhant's question, the newly elected maldivian... the maldivian president-elect, mentioned his intention to ask indian troops to leave the maldives. did our high commissioner raise that concern with the newly elected president? pia: hi, pia with the print. it has been made aware that the consul generals from the afghan consulates were in delhi to meet the mea earlier this week. is there any plan to shift diplomats from afghan consulates to the mission in delhi, and will there be any replacement of the former ambassador farid mamundzay? thank you. madhurendra: sir, madhurendra hoon news nation se. american report ke mutabik china jo hai wo deceptive methods ko use kar raha hai disinformation ke liye, bharat mein bhi jis tarah ka nivesh samne aaya hai aur uske baad ed ke actions bhi dikhai de rahe hain. kya aapka reaction hai? china ka antarashtiya media mai interference aur bharat ke media mai bhi interference ko lekar? [question in hindi: approximate translation] sir, i am madhurendra from news nation. according to the american report, china is using deceptive methods for disinformation. also the type of investments in india, that have come to light followed by actions by the ed. what is your reaction to china's interference in international media and also in indian media? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: okay. any specific aap kuch kehna chahte hain ya generally? [question in hindi: approximate translation] anything specific you want to ask or is it generally? madhurendra: sawal american reports par hain jo kehta hain ki deceptive methods ka istemal china kar raha hai, manipulate karne ke liye antarashtiya media ko. [question in hindi: approximate translation] the question is about american reports that suggest china is using deceptive methods to manipulate international media. kallol: kallol from the hindu. taking that question forward, there is this american entrepreneur neville singham who has hit the headlines for his support to various media initiatives. do you think the indian government would take it up with the u.s. counterpart on the issue of neville singam's media initiatives that are related to india, including the latest newsclick issue? geeta mohan: geeta mohan with india today. this is regarding khalistanis not in canada but in the united states of america and london. you have paramjeet singh pamma who took part in the protests outside the indian high commission. he is a wanted criminal in the nia list... a wanted terrorist, not a criminal. and on the other hand, u.s. state department, when asked about seeks for justice, said that they have a right to protest. it is enshrined in the constitution of america. your comments on khalistanis being given space in u.s. and in the u.k.? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: okay, let me take this round and i'll come back to another one. okay, shashank, your query on maldives, i mean, you specifically talk about cooperation, security sector. look, all i would say is, i don't want to comment on... i think you talked about media reports, to be honest. the focus of our partnership with maldives has always been on capacity building and working together to address our shared challenges and priorities, you know, including security challenges and priorities. as neighbours, we need to collaborate closely to address these challenges confronting our region, such as transnational crimes as well as hadr, humanitarian assistance disaster relief situations. we look forward to engaging with the new administration in maldives on all these issues. on the issue of...geeta, on khalistan that you mentioned as well as in security...look, i wasn't sure in what context the u.s.... you referred to a statement, i understand, from the u.s... was it state department, you said something? but look, let me just say, we have been taking up concerns about the security of our diplomats and our premises and other elements related to people there who are wanted by our security or our judicial systems, and we will continue to do that, and that's an ongoing conversation. i don't want to get into individual persons, but in the uk there was a protest on 2nd october, and we certainly have taken up our concerns on the security of diplomats and premises there with the uk authorities, and this has been an ongoing thing. the issue is about security, about ensuring that our diplomats are able to function normally and our premises are safe and that the community is not targeted. i think that's a broad element. i don't want to get into individual cases. pia, your question was related to the consul generals, something, a replacement of ambassador. it's a very, very hypothetical and speculative question. i must say, just let me answer what i can, which is that, yes, of course, as i mentioned, we are in touch with the afghan diplomats, as i mentioned, not only just in delhi, but also in their consulates in mumbai and in hyderabad. in terms of... they are discussing what would be the future action, what would they like to do in terms of their message that they give. they are foreign diplomats. we are not going to be discussing what they will do, who will replace whom. i think that's not within the ambit of the government of india. so, if i got your question right, you said replacement of ambassador and they are discussing? yes, we are discussing. we are in touch. we said that what is their plans and i mentioned that, i think, in my opening remarks, that what would be their future course of action. but beyond that, i don't have anything particular to share. madhurendra ji aapka prashn tha about us report ki china kuch kar raha hai is tarah se. dekhiye aise reports par main kuch keh nahi sakta, agar koi bhi hamare desh ke kanoon ka ullanghan ho raha hain, is tarah se kuch kar raha hai toh hamari agencies action lengi us pe. aur iske alawa speculatory reports pe main comment nahi karna chahunga. [answer in hindi: approximate translation] madhurendra ji, your question was about the us report suggesting that china is doing something in this manner. see, i cannot comment on such reports. if someone is violating our country's laws, doing something like that; our agencies will take action on it. apart from that, i do not want to comment on speculative reports. kallol, on your query, again, i don't know why in specific context that one individual or otherwise. if our agencies find that there have been violations of our law by an entity or an individual and it requires assistance or reaching out to foreign governments, we do that. and we would do that if our agencies asked us, as and when they do. i don't have anything specific to share on one individual or a particular case. kadambini sharma: kadambini sharma from ndtv. ek khabar chhapi hain scotland ke gurudware mai jo ghatna hui thi usko lekar ki police report mai kaha hai, usko janch karne ke baad, ki usmai koi criminality nahi hai, kya isko aage take up kiya ja raha hai? jo high commissioner aur baki jano ke sath. [question in hindi: approximate translation] this is kadambini sharma from ndtv. there was a news published regarding the incident that happened at the gurudwara in scotland. it says that after investigation, the police report said there is no criminality involved in it. is this being taken up further? with respect to the high commissioner and the rest of the people. sudhi ranjan: sir sudhi ranjan from bloomberg. on the canada issue, sir, if you could give us an understanding as to when or by which time you expect india and canada to get the parity on diplomatic staff. also, drawing your attention to a recent report by the politico, which says that u.s. ambassador has kind of informed the staff that they are curtailing or cutting down interaction with indian officials and this follows india's spat with canada. if you can comment on that. megha sharma: my name is megha sharma. i am from news x. my question is regarding the maldivian president who has been elected recently and saying that he is going to cut down, in fact, remove all the indian military troops because they are staying.... shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: i just answer that, but i am happy to.. i just answered this one, but i think you just walked in late. i am happy to repeat that to you. megha sharma: okay. and the second question, with regards to the prime minister of canada coming out and saying that he wants the diplomats to be present in india so as to ease out the visa processing for students and indian nationals, what is the response of the indian government? how are you then going to facilitate these visas if the diplomats are not present? suhasini haidar: two separate questions. please, one is a follow-up. it's only a few months since india actually asked canada to hasten its visa process. by cutting down two-thirds of the canadian mission's diplomatic staff, do you anticipate a decrease in the number of visas that the canadian high commission may be able to provide, particularly in states like punjab and gujarat, and for students who might be going for the fall or the spring terms in canada? and how are you hoping to work around that since the mea does get involved in such consular issues? and my second question is about the afghan embassy, because i don't think you've responded to the question yet on the specific allegations against the ministry of external affairs for failing to provide support to the afghan embassy. this includes things like exit visas for afghan diplomats posted here, visas for their families to either come here or to leave from here, as well as what they stated was their duty to help afghan students. they named about 3,000 of them who are stuck inside afghanistan, have admissions to indian colleges, and have not received a single visa for two years now. nirmala: nirmala with the straits times. this is also a follow-up to the afghan question. you mentioned that the government has provided assistance or is looking at providing assistance to afghan nationals in india. could you please elaborate on that? and also, there are a lot of students in india whose visas have expired or whose passports have expired. so what is the message to them? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: message to? nirmala ganapathy: message as in what, you know, how, in terms of help. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: okay, let me start with the ones in canada. look, sudhi, as i said, i think there are conversations that are ongoing, and i don't want to get into details of diplomatic conversations. as and when we have something to share on that...but as i mentioned, we have sought parity and i have outlined the reasons why. on the report that you mentioned, okay, some political report, i also saw. but i saw also a statement by the u.s. spokesperson here of the embassy saying that he dismisses those reports. in any case, i'm not going to comment on them. they are the internal report of somebody saying something on the u.s. side. but the u.s., i think, state department is...or the embassy here has just dismissed those reports, i think, a few minutes ago. so i don't need to comment on them, hopefully. similarly, i think this question, suhasini, related to canada and also megha...on maldives, you can please take it. i have already answered the question on cooperation. suhasini, on the defence part...look, on the issue you mentioned specifically on visas, right? now, yes, we had, i think, initially talked about expired visas, for those who required. but let me also clarify in the context of the parity, it's up to the canadian side who they choose to staff their high commission with. so i would refer you to them, for any details. in this regard, our concerns are related to ensuring parity in diplomatic presence. and again, as i said, why. and i think, you know, that's been our focus very clearly. on the issue of prime minister of canada, megha, you had mentioned about ease of visa processing, they should stay. again, as i said, we are looking at parity, we are looking at the fact that there have been interference and there has been a much higher number of canadian diplomats here. and hence, the discussions on achieving parity are ongoing and rest of it, i can't comment on it yet. obviously, if the parity is achieved, given that canada has a much larger number of people there, would likely be a reduction in the numbers. megha sharma: (inaudible) shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: as i said, our focus is on ensuring parity. it is possible, as i said, the canadian side may choose who they staff their high commission with. i wanted to mention also about...i think afghanistan came up, right? nirmala, your question was about what should...look, on the consular services, it's for the afghan embassy and the consulates to provide. in terms of assistance, we have...whoever are here, the visas have been regularized, they've been staying here if they are unable to return or some other reason. so afghan nationals are here. they're here for various reasons. some are students, some have done itec courses. those who are unable to return, their visas are being regularized on an ongoing basis. we've also announced now... i think iccr a few weeks ago, 1000 e-courses, online courses for students from afghanistan. our assistance programs for the people of afghanistan have continued. we have a technical team precisely for that reason in kabul so that we are able to continue that assistance. suhasini, your larger issue of the comments...look, i don't want to get into a statement which they have made, which i said there are discussions and others have disagreed. but let me just make a general comment that i don't think facts bear out what...i won't say allegations, but those statements are, in what you have referred to. i don't think they're factually correct and i don't think that's accurate, many of them. but again, i don't want to get into a discussion on that. we are in touch with diplomats here, as i said, in the embassy here and in the consulates. i don't wish to get into an issue, which is more specifically on a letter. kadambini aapka prashn tha gurudwara ke bare mai, usmai jo incident hua tha glasgow mai uski ke bare mai aap jikar kar rahe the, jismai hamare ucchayog ne ek bayan, statement de rakhi hai. aaj humne dekha ki kuch report hain, par woh abhi haal hi ki baat hai ki aur koi criminal activity nahi hai. dekhiye woh individual case take up karenge ya nahi, main abhi kehna nahi chahta hoon, hum bhi dekhenge exactly unhone kya dekha tha us individual ke bare mai. but jaisa ki unhone, hamare ucchayog ne kaha ki hamare high commissioner ko roka gaya, threaten kiya gaya, ye hum accept nahi kar sakte isliye isko humne uk high authorities ke sath raise kiya tha, aur hum karte rahenge taki hamare diplomats wahan pe normal tarike se apne jo karya hain woh kar sake aur unke pas koi badha na ho na koi aise security threat unke upar aaye. [answer in hindi: approximate translation] kadambini, your question was about the gurudwara incident in glasgow, which you mentioned, in which a statement has been issued by our high commission. today, we have seen some reports, which are recent and they indicate that there is no further criminal activity. whether they will take up individual case or not, i don't want to comment at the moment. we will also see exactly what they found regarding that individual. but, as our high commission stated, our high commissioner was stopped and threatened. we cannot accept this, so we raised the issue with the uk high authorities, and we will continue to do so to ensure that our diplomats can carry out their duties without any hindrance or security threats. vishal: sir main vishal hoon zee news se, hamne dekha ki jabse canada ke pradhan mantri ne bebuniyad aarop lagaye aur bharat ne kada rukh apanaya uske baad canada ke pm ke bayan lagatar badal rahe the. humne unka ek bayan suna jisme uhone kaha ki bharat ek badhti aarthik shakti hai aur mahavapurna bhu rajnitik taakat hai, aur hum ghanist sambandh banane ke liye gambhir hain. kya aapko lagta hai ki ye bayan bharat ke kade rukh ko dekhte hue canada ki taraf se aaya hai?

[+] night. exercise and body care. as interest grows in ecotourism and responsible travel, these travel spots deliver wildlife, bioluminescence, nature education, and unparalleled beauty. tired of tourists, long lines, smoggy cities, and commercialized entertainment? while those options have a place in our vacation plans, more and more travelers are moving away from tourist-heavy destinations in favor of quieter, nature-loving adventures. according to a report by grandview research, growth in ecotourism comes from a desire for immersive travel and outdoor activities that do not adversely affect the environment, instead educating on how to interact with and preserve it. whether by land or sea, ecotourism and sustainable travel are on the rise, and why not? it’s not just responsible — it’s fun! here are my picks for five trips across the nation that bring you closer to nature while protecting the environment. illumination of plankton at maldives. many particles at black background. seeing nighttime sea life is usually a treat reserved only for scuba divers, but in select spots around the world, bioluminescent organisms glow close to the surface. in the maldives, they wash in with the waves, leaving a trail of sparkling gems in their wake. but you don’t have to go nearly that far for these rare sightings. in st. augustine, florida, make your way to guana lake, where geotrippin kayak adventures will hook you up with everything you need to watch the nighttime waters come alive. hop in a kayak and join a small group paddling out into the lake and through estuaries where the river meets the sea. as the sun sets and the sky darkens, dip your small fishing net into the water and watch as the swirl lights up with comb jellies and dinoflagellates. you can even capture them in a cup and study them up close, then release them back into the water. by day, kayak the matanzas river basin, where you will see everything from dolphins, manatees, and sea turtles to wading birds and oysters. the expert guides at geotrippin will educate you on the history of this ecosystem, the science behind it, and the flora and fauna that make it special. owner ben brandao is all about protecting the environment and letting it work its magic, so tours are engaging and interactive. the bioluminescent nighttime kayak tour is appropriate for all levels, even first-time kayakers, but there are only 12 spots open each night, so make your reservations early! a guide from rocky mountain conservancy field institute teaches a small group how to identify edible ... [+] plants. self-sustainability has become all the rage in recent years, but many people don’t know how to get started. while most are comfortable with a small backyard garden, they have no idea what wild plants are safe to pick, let alone consume. here’s a way to turn your vacation into an opportunity to learn the history and science behind foraging from experts in the field. through rocky mountain conservancy field institute, you can have an educational adventure, or, as they call it, “a classroom without walls.” meet up with a foraging expert who will take you to jaw-droppingly gorgeous lily lake. reflecting the mountain range that includes the fourteeners of longs peak, the lake is a must-see no matter the season. your guide will introduce you to the native plants identified by the utes, the indigenous people who passed down much of their knowledge. you’ll identify yarrow and learn that you can chew it, make a poultice, and use it to calm mosquito bites and bee stings. suffering in the high elevation of the rockies? your guide will point out mountain gum weed, which you can suck on to open your bronchial passages. or pick some wild raspberry leaves (outside of the park) and make natural tea back in your hotel room. be sure to check the calendar for seasonal courses and your choice from a wide range of topics, including wildflowers, mammals, birds, cultural history, outdoor skills, photography, painting and writing. big horn sheep scramble among the rocks that line the snake river in idaho.  the only way to explore north america’s deepest river gorge (yes, deeper than the grand canyon) is by boat, as roads will only take you so far. and if you’re going to spend a half to a full day on the water, you might as well do it in a speedy jet boat. book a ride with snake river adventures and skim over the rapids as you take in the glorious scenery of three states: idaho, washington, and oregon. the snake river winds its way along a 1,036-mile stretch through volcanic mountains and lava tubes that run vertically along rock edges. shiny black rocks covered in a manganese patina sparkle among hackberry and mahogany trees. your ride will stop at the waterside visitors center that serves as the entrance to hells canyon national recreation area. it’s the best place for a picnic, the river running through the canyon as your soundtrack. you’ll see fishermen catching giant white sturgeon, bass, rainbow trout, and chinook salmon, but the wildlife is about to become a whole lot wilder. from this point on, you will go where no roads can take you. you’ll see bald eagles, bighorn sheep, cougars, mountain lions, beer, osprey nests, and even petroglyphs. better yet, cell phone service is nil, so you can truly relax into the moment. visitors to alabama participate in a spring bird banding event.  alabama has named 2023 the year of alabama birding and is dedicated to educating visitors on what makes it one of the best birding states in the country. birding hotspots (to the tune of 280 updated sites), festivals, and eight birding trails highlight the state’s more than 430 species of birds. a stroll down one of the pathways can elicit everything from bald eagles and whooping cranes to swallow-tailed kites and painted buntings. alabama’s many forests, lakes, and waterways make it one of the major stop-off points for migrating birds. for best viewing, check their website for seasonal and hotspot tips. depending on your preference, you can target the coast, piedmont plateau, piney woods, wiregrass, or west alabama, or road trip through them all. boaters spot a majestic whale in the waters surrounding loreto, baja california sur.  rodolfo palacios with sail loreto is an invaluable resource when it comes to learning about the local ecosystem. offering small boat sailing cruises, courses, and charters, he and his team will help you get familiar with loreto and all it has to offer. start by sailing among the five islands of bahía de loreto national park, a unesco world heritage site known for its marine diversity, especially marine mammals. the gulf of california, nicknamed the sea of cortez, teems with life – 43 species of marine mammals and 900 species of fish, 77 of which are found only here in these waters. depending on the time of year, you’ll see dolphins, whales, and sea lions. snorkel or dive with five of the seven marine turtle species, then come up for air and watch as blue-footed boobies alight on white rock outcroppings. a four-hour sail around the islands is just $65, and snorkeling is just $70, a bargain when you consider all you’ll see in this one body of water. knowing that you’re getting an education and protecting the environment makes this deal all the sweeter.",Positive

unprecedentedsurprise attackon israel more than a week ago, much of the international community rushed tovoice its concernabout the escalation in tensions. however, as israel continues tobomb gazaand attack palestinians in the occupied west bank, several governments have started to turn critical of israel’s actions — some more directly than others. here is a list of countries that have called on israel to stop its aggression and move towards a ceasefire. the algerian ministry of foreign affairs has expressed deep concern over israel’s attacks on gaza, accusing it of violating international humanitarian law. algeria has also called for immediate international intervention to protect the palestinian people, whose rights it has described as central to the resolution of the conflict. the chairperson of the african union moussa faki mahamat has highlighted the denial of the fundamental rights of the palestinian people as the main cause of the current tensions. the au appealed to both parties to end military hostilities and return to the negotiating table. belize has decried the hostilities between hamas and israel and called for immediate de-escalation while supporting a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital and demanding the right of return for palestinians displaced from their ancestral homeland. brazil’s foreign minister mauro luiz iecker vieirasaidon friday that his country has “received with dismay the news that israeli forces called for all civilians — more than one million — living in northern gaza to leave within 24 hours”. veira, who was speaking in new york after a united nations security council meeting, referred to the un’s assessment that such a large-scale move of people could lead to “unprecedented levels of misery” for civilians while calling for an end to violence on both sides. colombian president gustavo petro emphasised the need for israel and palestine to come to the negotiation table and work towards a two-state solution. he drew historical comparisons between the situation in gaza and past atrocities. in a statement posted on x, formerly twitter, he said: “gaza today appears asdestroyedor more so than the warsaw ghetto after it was destroyed by nazi barbarity in response to the jewish and socialist insurrection in that concentration camp.” cuba has condemned the violence in israel and palestine, attributing it to the long-standing violation of palestinian rights. indonesia has urged an immediate end to violence to prevent further casualties, also arguing that the occupation of palestinian territories by israel was the root cause of the conflict as the occupation. iraq has likewise called the attacks on gaza a continuation of the oppression of palestinians under israel’s occupation. iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson nasser kanaani has described palestinian resistance as a natural reaction to israel’s provocations. ireland’s prime minister leo varadkar has condemned israel’s actions of cutting off power, fuel supplies and water, calling it aviolation of international humanitarian lawand collective punishment. kuwait’s ministry of foreign affairs has expressed concern over the escalation in gaza, calling on the international community to stop the violence, protect the palestinian people, and end israel’s provocations. it has warned that the continuation of violence without deterrence would undermine peace efforts and the prospects of a two-state solution. morocco, which is moving towards full diplomatic ties with israel under the abraham accords, has voiced deep concern over the situation in gaza and called for an immediate cessation of violence and a return to calm. the country emphasised the importance of dialogue and negotiations as the way to reach a two-state solution. in an arab league session, morocco’s minister of foreign affairs nasser bourita, emphasised morocco’s “full and unwavering support” for palestine. malaysia has called for an end to the violence in thegaza strip, highlighting the prolonged occupation and suffering of the palestinian people, and the desecration of al-aqsa mosque as the root cause of the conflict. the maldivian government has expressed concern about the escalating violence in the gaza strip and reiterated its solidarity with the palestinian people. its government has said that lasting peace in the middle east can only be achieved through a two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with east jerusalem as the capital of palestine. norwegian foreign minister anniken huitfeldt has criticised thetotal blockade of gazaas unacceptable and emphasised that israel’s right to self-defence must adhere to international law. “the establishment of a full blockade, including on access to electricity, water, food, and other goods that are indispensable for the survival of the civilian population in gaza, is unacceptable,” huitfeldt said in a statement. “the scale of destruction in gaza is enormous. a large number of civilians have been killed. given a full blockade by israel, closed border crossings, and continued israeli attacks, i fear that the civilian population in gaza will face even greater hardship in the days to come,” she added. oman’s ministry of foreign affairs has expressed concern over the ongoing escalation between palestinians and israelis, emphasising the need for both parties to exercise restraint, and calling for international intervention to stop the escalation. stressing the importance of adhering to international law, oman highlighted the strategic necessity of finding a just, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the palestinian issue based on the two-state solution. pakistan’s caretaker fm jalil abbas jilani has condemned the israeli bombing on the besieged gaza strip, equating the actions as “genocide”. “this is a humanitarian crisis, a situation which can be equated to genocide. in fact, it is genocide being conducted by israel against the people of palestine,” jilani said. “our position is that any attempt to equate israel, which is the aggressor, with that of the palestinian struggle, is unacceptable to pakistan.” pakistan does not recognise the state of israel and has historically said that the occupied palestinian territories must be vacated in line with the un resolutions on a two-state solution. qatar qatar has called for all parties to de-escalate and exercise restraint amid the escalating situation in gaza, holding israel responsible for the escalation due to its violations of palestinian rights, particularly incursions into al-aqsa mosque. the ministry of foreign affairs urged the international community to compel israel to respect international law and the historical rights of the palestinian people and prevent further violence against palestinian civilians. qatar has reiterated its firm position in support of the palestinian cause, including the establishment of an independent state based on the 1967 borders with east jerusalem as its capital. russia stressed that the israeli-palestinian conflict cannot be resolved by force but through political and diplomatic means. russia called for an immediate ceasefire, renouncing violence, and a negotiation process with international community assistance to establish lasting peace in the middle east. president vladimir putin has emphasised the “creation of an independent palestine state with east jerusalem as its capital” to resolve the issue. moscow has also refused to list hamas as a “terrorist” organisation following similar steps taken by france and the european union earlier this week. syria has praised the palestinian resistance factions behind last the october 7 attack, while criticising israel’s occupation and siege. south

front of people holding aloft small palestinian flags. “all of us standing here pledge our solidarity with the people of palestine,” he said. he described israel as an “oppressive regime” and pointed to what many human rights groups have described as israel’s apartheid-like policies towards palestinians. the government of venezuela voiced its anxiety concerning the situation in the gaza strip and called for the end of violence throughout palestinian territory through direct dialogue and compliance with un security council resolution 2334. venezuela urged the united nations to fulfil its role

""there's lots of laughing, lots of screaming… but when the 30-metre whale goes by, for some reason, everyone goes silent like they are in awe and reverence of such a magnificent creature,"" explains bruce dell, the chief executive of axiom holographics and creator of hologram zoo. it is digital trickery, hoodwinking the brain into seeing something that isn't really there.  ""you are projecting an object in the air that appears to be real because as you walk around it you are seeing it from all sorts of different angles. so, you use laser light and we project these objects into the air,"" he tells the bbc.  ""the animals come into the room, they walk through the tunnel and you pat them just like in the movies.  you're seeing an animal made of light in front of you.  you'll go out and reach out your hand and pat a lion."" the hologram show uses a new ""depth"" technology that makes the animals seem big. the moving images are brought to life by a laser projector containing crystals that let simple sunglasses worn by guests separate fields of light.  crucially, there's a device that knows where everyone in the room is, creating a tailored virtual experience. the hologram shows also come with sensory technology, allowing visitors to smell the flowers and trees.   the technology that illuminates axiom's theme park in suburban brisbane is shining elsewhere.  bruce dell tells the bbc his company has contracts with aerospace giant airbus and us corporation honeywell, as well as building a hologram aquarium for a luxury hotel owned by bill gates in the maldives. the founder of the hologram zoo says he's rethinking the industry by cutting costs and enhancing quality, by making components at a purpose-built factory in the australian state of queensland. ""everyone is expecting the hologram revolution. it is something we see in science fiction and we should have had it by now. but holograms have always been so expensive. we felt there were some things to do there to make them a lot cheaper,"" mr dell explains.  ""holograms normally take tremendous amounts of computing power. you'll normally have 10 computers hooked together to do them. because of our good understanding of how computer memory management works, we've been able to make algorithms that reduce holograms down to just one computer."" more technology of business in canberra, another race towards reimagining the concepts of holography is well underway. researchers at the australian national university (anu) say they're disrupting ancient laws of physics that use lenses and mirrors to spread light. the anu team is experimenting with meta-optics, or nano-photonics. when light beams pass over tiny meta surfaces, which are just millimetres in size, they can manipulate the wave, similar to a traditional lens, but at a much smaller scale. ""we are trying to push into the future of these technologies.  when we are able to miniaturise these lasers to put them on a small portable device is when we will make the leap,"" said prof dragomir neshev from the anu's research school of physics. ""at the moment, everything is based on where the holograms were at the very start in the '60s and '70s.""  meta-surfaces could turn reading spectacles into night-vision glasses, replace diagnostic blood tests with breath tests, and tell us when food in the fridge has gone off. prof neshev believes holographic techniques could be ""transformational"" for medicine, and help to guide surgeons deep inside the body of a patient at a cellular level with real-time images. hologram techniques have also inspired what's described as a ""world-first collaboration"" between psychology and theatre at the queensland university of technology (qut).  alex is an hour-long play about a child who has lost her father, and charts her attempts to find him as well as her own journey of self-discovery.  it is embedded with a strong mental health message. the show's producers say it is an ""arts-based clinical intervention for people with eating disorders"". ""alex looks very much like a traditional play, any other trip to the theatre, until the holographic image appears. it looks more like the film roger rabbit; real actors and animations inhabiting the same theatrical space,"" says dr shane pike, the play's author from qut's school of creative practice. ""the technology used to create alex is both surprisingly simple and complicated at the same time. basically, this is augmented reality (ar) without the need for wearable devices, goggles or a smart device that has to be held up in order for the ar image to appear on the screen."" while holograms create a completely virtual world, augmented reality at qut uses a special effects screen, called a hologauze, to bring the play's virtual characters to the stage. ""it's a special material that appears invisible to the naked eye, but when lit with an image projected from our high-powered projectors it is captured by the gauze and appears as an embodied character.  we connect the animations through motion-capture technology to a real-life actor backstage,"" dr pike tells the bbc. australian researchers hope to eventually create lifelike moving holograms that display straight from a smart phone screen. bruce dell has recently curated a hologram dinosaur show at the australian museum in sydney. he sees an omnipresent future for holograms, including floating hamburgers and pizzas at fast food restaurants, and virtual 3d gems to entice buyers at jewellery shops. ""often we talk about technology revolutions; television, cars, mobile phones, light bulbs, and the question is what is the next one?  well, the media has been telling us, science fiction has been telling us for years, the next one is the hologram revolution, having holographic things everywhere,"" he predicts.",Neutral

status match. mosaic 3 and 4 members can also gift mosaic 1 status as well as use upgrade certificates for confirmed mint seats (rather than waitlisting for them). the number of certificates needed is changing, however. instead of one or two needed for a flight, the number will be based on a dynamic pricing model, potentially costing up to four per segment. the ability to confirm space in advance is a major improvement though. marriott and united boost reciprocal elite perks united and marriott have a shared loyalty partnership that benefits each others' top customers. there has long been a mutual elite status benefit for top elites in the marriott bonvoy and united mileageplus program. now, both programs are taking things a step further by offering bonus miles or points by linking

[operator], would you mind please repeating the institutions for joining the question queue? operator:  ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your phone.  press 1 then 0 only one time, as pressing it a second time will remove you from the question-and-answer queue. moderator:  great.  can we please go to the line of jennifer hansler from cnn. question:  hi, can you hear me? operator:  yes. question:  thank you.  thank you for doing this call.  i'm wondering whether you have any insights on why this agreement was able to reach in this iteration of negotiations, given we've seen a number of times where there have been negotiations that fell apart.  and then separately, do you see this as paving the way or setting any sort of ground for the potential release of the u.s. detainees in venezuela?  thank you. senior administration official one:  so let me start and then maybe [senior administration official two] will want to make some comments as well.  the effort to get the parties back to the negotiating table has involved a lot of hard work and support from the international community.  in a statement released by the u.s., canada, and the eu yesterday, sort of recognized the international community, in particular norway for its role in facilitating these talks.  the united states, with the assistance of qatar, has worked to support and encourage this process as well and make sure that an incentive structure to make real changes exists.  and there's still a significant amount of work that remains, but i think this is absolutely the best way forward for us. with regard to the release of wrongfully detained americans and political prisoners, for us that is a sine qua non for this agreement, and we have conveyed our expectation clearly that that will be a key part of the implementation of this process. senior administration official two:  and i'll add just briefly that the representatives of the unitary platform of the venezuelan opposition, even before going to barbados, had been engaged in regular conversations with the other side, and so the signature in barbados was the culmination of a lot of work.  i want to underscore as well that the united states coordinates very closely with the unitary platform and other democratic actors on the steps needed to move forward on a negotiated solution that leads to competitive elections and the restoration of democracy in venezuela. i think we've been very clear that our policy is to alleviate sanctions pressure on the basis of concrete steps that take the country toward competitive elections and improve the humanitarian situation in the country.  and as the unitary platform was negotiating and getting to an agreement, our efforts were to support them, give them the incentives necessary to be able to get towards signature. moderator:  great.  thank you so much.  could we please go to the line of carolina alcalde from voice of america? operator:  your line is now open. question:  yes, hi.  i just want to know about the inhabilitations (inaudible).  is maybe united states speaking with the maduro government in order to allowed, for example, maría corina machado to run into the elections in 2024? senior administration official one:  so the partial agreement signed yesterday clearly states that the promotion of a way forward for all candidates to be able to run and be authorized is part of that process agreed to by the parties.  i know that the unitary platform's lead negotiator, gerardo blyde, has specifically pressed this issue in the negotiations, and this is something that we consider vital to the process.  and we also very clearly stated that this is essential for venezuelans to be able to have a choice, a democratic choice, for all candidates to have a path toward being authorized and running. question:  i'm sorry, i'm asking that because mr. rodriguez yesterday said that it's not possible that, for example, maría corina machado can run into that elections because she don't have - she's inhabilitated - inhabilitado, i'm sorry. senior administration official one:  so the agreement that he signed says that there will be a path to authorize all candidates, and the clear understanding and the context of the negotiations has been that the maduro authorities will act expeditiously to authorize all candidates, and that's certainly our understanding of the way forward.  the maduro authorities don't have a role in the primary process that will take place on sunday, so it's not required for that.  but for the general election, obviously, all the candidates need to have a path to authorization and an expeditious one. senior administration official two:  if i could put a specific point on what [senior administration official one] said, is we have conveyed our expectation directly to representatives of nicolas maduro that they will take these - those steps before the end of november.  so to your question, define a specific timeline for the expedited reauthorization or rehabilitation of all candidates - underscore all, because fundamentally all who want to run for president should be allowed the opportunity so that venezuelans are the ones who pick their political leadership. and on the other, i can't underscore enough that the - we need to see the beginning of the release of all wrongfully detained u.s. nationals and venezuelan political prisoners.  so for us, in addition to the terms of the electoral roadmap, we are insisting on seeing progress in these two areas before the end of november or we're going to have to reconsider what has been, from our perspective, a fairly significant incentive for the parties to move forward with this electoral roadmap.  over. moderator:  great, thank you so much.  can we please go to the line of eduard ribas from efe news? question:  yes, hi, thank you.  thank you for doing this.  i would like to know what concrete steps you want to see to consider the elections of venezuela to be democratic, and also if the united states considers being an observer in these next elections.  thank you. senior administration official one:  so among the steps that the parties have agreed to and that we consider very important: updating the electoral registry; allowing international observers - the carter center, the european union, in particular, have observed elections in venezuela previously and have a track record of seriousness and impartiality; the promotion of a public discourse and a political and social climate favorable to carrying out a peaceful and participatory electoral process; the measures to guarantee the safety, security, and freedom of movement of all candidates throughout the country; transparent financing mechanisms to ensure people are able to compete in an equitable way; access to the media. all of those things are vital to a competitive, transparent election that represents the will of the venezuelan people, and the parties have agreed to them.  and we believe that that sets the framework for an election that will return venezuela to a democratic path.  i'll pause there.  my colleague may want to offer some additional thoughts. senior administration official two:  nope, nothing to add. moderator:  great, thank you so much.  can we please go to the line of haik gugarats from argus media? operator:  your line is now open. question:  yes, hi.  it's not clear from your frequently answered questions:  does this affect u.s. government position on citgo trial or any other venezuelan assets in the united states? senior administration official one:  this action does not affect the judicial process related to the citgo bankruptcy trial, nor does it impact the frozen assets of venezuela in the united states or other jurisdictions.  with regard to the latter, i'd note that the united nations has announced that a year after - almost a year after the signing of the humanitarian and social agreement in november of last year, it has taken steps to establish the un humanitarian trust fund, and there could be certain assets that are transferred into that trust fund, though that process has not begun yet.  but that is not related to the things that we've announced today. senior administration official two:  one thing i would add to what was said was - which [senior administration official one], i think, alluded to - is that not only are frozen assets not going to be made available except for access for the - with the un trust fund, but we have still in place a very robust sanctions program in venezuela.  not only that, but the actions today will not impact the iran-related sanctions or sanctions that we have in other areas as they impact or have implications for the venezuelan oil and gas sector.  over. moderator:  thank you so much.  can we please go to nick pope from the daily caller? question:  hello there.  can i - am i being heard? senior administration official one:  yes, go ahead. question:  okay, great.  thank you very much.  thanks for hosting the call; i appreciate it.  i'm curious to know if there's any concern, either within the state department or perhaps the administration more broadly, about alleged and sometimes reported connections between the venezuelan government and transnational criminal organizations, and whether or not those connections are factoring into the discussions here and this deal more broadly. senior administration official one:  so the sanctions relief that we're talking about now, as i think was touched upon in the last answer, this does not affect it - specific sanctions with regard to other criminal activity like narcotics trafficking or human rights violations.  so anyone who's covered by those sanctions would continue to be covered still, and we continue to be concerned about any violations of law committed, and the international authorities and the u.s. authorities continue to look very closely at those matters, so that - this hasn't changed our position on those things. moderator:  great.  well, that concludes all of our questions.  with that, the call has now concluded, and as a reminder, this evening's call was on background, attributable to senior administration officials.  the embargo has now lifted.  thank you all for joining us.

(answer in hindi: approximate translation) ms. vijai laxmi, to your question as to how many indians have come back from there. look, under the ongoing operation ajay, approximately 1200 people on five flights have come back so far, including 18 nepali nationals. we are taking stock of this situation and will arrange more flights as per requirement. you also asked about gaza. there were about four indians there; however, we don't have the exact number yet, we are coordinating on that, and also, as i said, about 12 or 13 people were in west bank. the situation in gaza is such that it's very difficult to travel from there, but if possible that they come back...there are some reports that 1 or 2 have managed to return, but i won't like to give wrong information, without confirmation. but our operation which is ongoing in israel, flights from tel aviv, as i said, 1200 indian nationals have traveled in five flights so far, and we are planning more flights as per demand. on the larger issue of what has happened on indianâ€¦meghna, your query was on indian casualties. no, i, thankfully, have not received any reports of any indian casualty. as i had mentioned, one indian national had been injured. she is receiving medical care, and i understand her condition is now stable. as regards, sandeep ji aapka prashna lebanon pe, dekhiye waha pe koi advisory abhi tak nahin humne issue kiya hai, zarurat padega ham us tarah se advisory issue karenge. hum situation pe nazar banaye hue hain, aur jis tarah se developments hongi us tarah se, abhi ke liye koi advisory nahin hai.

yes, ayushi, you had a query. ayushi agarwal: sir, ayushi agarwal from ani. sir, i would like to have your comment on the recent media interview of the president-elect of maldives, muizzu, where he said that he will request the indian government to remove its troops on day one after he takes charge. also, he said that during his meeting with the indian high commissioner, he mentioned this as a top priority of his foreign policy. so your comment on that? and also, has he taken up this matter with new delhi diplomatically, as he stated in the interview? sandeep dikshit: sir i am sandeep dikshit from the tribune. the maldives president-elect in an interview has said that he's open to joining bri, and they've talked highly of chinese projects that have been done. so what is the state of indian projects that are going on, and will they proceed their ways despite the change in government? sudhi ranjan: sir, sudhi ranjan from bloomberg. associating with two other questions previous to me, on maldives. also, anything particular and specific on the port that india was building in maldives and the assistance that the navy was giving to the maldivians, if you could give us an understanding on that. and plus, an unrelated question on venezuela. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: can i come back? anybody else on the maldives? reza: reza from the hindustan times. basically on bri, again, the meeting that is being held. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: can i come back to you? look, you asked different parts of it. do remember that the inauguration has not yet taken place and the president-elect is there. so it's the same administration for now we are discussing. let me make a larger point on cooperation with maldives. look, our cooperation with maldives is based on jointly addressing shared challenges and priorities. the assistance and platforms that we have provided have contributed significantly in areas like people's welfare, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and combating illegal maritime activities. over the last five years, more than 500 medical evacuations have been carried out by our personnel, saving 523 maldivian lives. of these, 131 evacuations were carried out this year, another 140 last year, and a further 109 in 2021. similarly, during the last five years, more than 450 multifaceted missions have been carried out to safeguard the maritime security of maldives. of these, 122 missions were carried out last year, while the 152 and 124 missions were undertaken in 2021 and 2020 respectively. india has also been the first responder for maldives in any disaster scenario, including most recently during covid. we look forward to constructively engaging with the incoming administration and discussing ways to enhance our relationship further. there was a specific query on whether these issues that the president-elect mentioned, has been taken up. look, he's president-elect, so as of now, of course, our high commissioner has met him, and i mentioned that we had a conversation, and we look forward to engaging with the incoming administration on all these issues. sudhi, to your query also, we look forward to continuing with our cooperation and partnership with maldives, which is multifaceted, which covers areas for benefit of the maldivian people, particularly in humanitarian assistance or welfare or disaster relief or other issues that i mentioned. as regards, sandeep, your query was on bri with maldives. again, that's a statement by president-elect. you know our views on bri. and i understand reza has a query, and i'll respond to that. but we are focused, as i said, with our neighbours and our partnership stand on their own merit, and we are focused on how we can take forward our bilateral cooperation. reza: reza from hindustan times. my question is basically on the bri meeting that was hosted by china, and you know how president xiâ€¦ and there was a reaffirmation from president putin about the need to coordinate on the foreign policy and to work together on these issues. how do you look at that, given the fact that president putin and president xi both did not attend the g20 meeting in delhi? sudhi ranjan: sir, sudhi ranjan again from bloomberg. on venezuela, sir, we see that the sanctions, us sanctions on venezuela, are being reduced or being diluted. will india start its economic engagement with venezuela, in particular, buying oil from venezuela? huma siddiqui: sir, huma siddiqui from the financial express. just adding on to sudhi ranjan's question. so if and when the sanctions are removed, will india start discussing about the pending payments which are stuck in venezuela? and what about the private company, jindals, they have bought or they are planning to buy some oil field there? avinash agarwal: avinash agarwal from the asahi shimbun. sir, this is about the planned g20 virtual summit. can you tell us if any date has been finalised so far, and if yes, how many leaders are expected to join? rajeev: hi, i am rajeev from malayala manorama. i just wanted to ask about the update on the eight indian naval officers detained in qatar, and also about the news that one or two journalists who had reported on this were asked to leave the country recently. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: you mean there? rajeev: yeah, who were based in doha, they were asked to leave the country for reporting on this. yeshi seli: this is yeshi again. i want to know whether india was invited for this bri forum, and if yes, why did india decide to skip it? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: let me take the bri query. reza, yeshiâ€¦look, i am loaths to link g20 participation, non-participation with any of these other things. for the g20, we have invited everybody, as i mentioned. as you recall, china was represented by their premier here. different countries have different decision-making perspectives when deciding on participation and that is pretty normal. i think we have answered that question at length earlier. as regards the bri, yeshi, i don't think we received an invitation this year. however, on our position on the bri, including its lack of respect for our sovereignty and territorial integrity, are well-known and consistent. i would refer you to our statements earlier, particularly the statement i think we made in may 2017. i think the first time the bri forum was being held, and i think those concerns stand even today. so, that would be on the bri. sudhi, as regards the issue of venezuela, your query was, will we start buying oil if the sanctions are diluted. look, as i said, our perspective on this - and this will be answered in the context of other countries where we managed to procure oil - is guided by our energy security requirements, how we look at it. so, depending on that a decision is taken. we would of course, for the benefit of our own people, like to have more sources and access to energy, and particularly oil. so, that is something that i wouldn't like to speculate, but the larger principle that guides it is ensuring the energy security of india. similarly, huma, you had said about jindals. look, that is the question you have to ask them. of course, as and when we are able to raise the issues of pending payments, etc, we will raise it; but again, i do not want to prejudge what could happen without any significant movement on the ground. this is something, of course, we keep a close eye on, and as and when there are developments, we will share with you. but some of this, of course, is done by the private sector or by traders. so, as i said, larger picture of being guided by our energy security requirements, i think, is overarching framework. avinash, you had asked about g20 virtual summit. yes, invitations have been extended. i am not sure the date is yet public. the countries know the date. there is a fixed date in november that we have, but let's hold up for announcing it publicly. as yet, i am sure other countries are aware of it. we look forward to participation by as many leaders as they can. it's a virtual event. but again, like i answered reza's query, participation is dependent on the invitee, but we do hope that there is high degree of participation at this summit. rajeev, you had asked about the developments in qatar. let me see if i have an update here. my understanding is that there was a last hearing, the 7th hearing, earlier this month. we are closely following the court proceedings in what is called the court of first instance. as i said, october 3rd was the 7th hearing. we understand that a judgment is expected, in fact, later this month. earlier, our ambassador and our deputy chief of mission met the eight men in prison on october 1st, after they were granted consular access. as you are aware, we have been in regular touch with the families too and we are rendering all possible assistance. so as and when we have more updates, we will share that with you. as regards journalists being asked to leave, i presume you are talking about non-qatari citizens. i don't have information on that. i don't even know if they are indian, i have noted. it hasn't come to our attention. nobody has complained to us. i will note it down. srinjoy: sir, the karakoram highway is being upgraded. it's a joint effort by pakistan and china. it's a 240-kilometre stretch between raikot and thakot which is being upgraded. besides that, there is a frontier tunnelling institute in pakistan that has begun work on the cpec. we just wanted your views on both. kallol: this is about the burning issue of the day, the palestine-israel conflict. shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: i just did a whole series of it. kallol: just one more, which is that, has india really made its position clear on the ceasefire? more than 3,700 palestinians have died, and more than 1,300 israelis are dead. many indians are living there and working. so what is really india's position on the ceasefire? reza: reza from hindustan times. just a clarification. you mentioned about the hearings in qatar, and that a judgment is awaited this month. does that mean that the charges have finally been laid against the indian sailors? shri arindam bagchi, official spokesperson: thank you. srinjoy, i wouldn't like to comment on specific developments that you mentioned, except to say that you know our position on thatâ€¦these are territories that are in illegal occupation of pakistan, and you know our position very clearly, on violation of our sovereignty and our territorial integrity. and let me reiterate the same. i don't want to comment on exactly what is being done, but our view on developments in pakistan-occupied kashmir are very clear, and i just have to reiterate them today on both these issues. i understand they do pass through those areas of pakistan-occupied kashmir that are part of indian territory. kallol, as i mentioned again, since you missed the first part and you justâ€¦let me reiterate what we've been saying. i think we have talked about the terror attack. we have condemned it, and i think it is important that the international community stand together to condemn it. on palestine, our position, we have reiterated our position in favour of direct negotiations for establishing a two-state solution. we have also expressed, in particular at your query, our concern at the civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation that is happening day by day, and we would urge the strict observance of international humanitarian law. so that is what i would like to share with you. reza, lookâ€¦yes, the charges were presented as part of the hearings. but again, i wouldn't like to get into the legal part of it. they have legal representation in court. we are now looking forward to, as i said, to the 7th hearing, to what the court judgment is. and we hope that they are able to return back to india. thank you for joining. good evening.

Officials and leaders from all over the globe ar… [+10563 chars]",Maldives,"china is throwing a huge party to celebrate one of its biggest experiments in engaging with the world: its belt and road initiative (bri). officials and leaders from all over the globe are in beijing attending a high-level summit marking the bri's 10th anniversary. russian president vladimir putin and hungarian prime minister viktor orban have arrived, and the taliban government will also attend. chinese media is awash with coverage of the bri's achievements, including a six-part documentary on state tv. a signature policy of president xi jinping, the bri is aimed at stitching china closer to the world through investments and infrastructure projects. with an unprecedented glut of cash pumped into nearly 150 countries, china boasts it has transformed the world - and it is not wrong.  but beijing's massive gamble hasn't entirely gone the way it had hoped. was it worth it?  from the moment the bri was unveiled in 2013 with comparisons to the ancient silk road, it was clear china had sprawling ambitions. ""belt"" refers to overland routes connecting china to europe through central asia, as well as to south asia and south east asia; while ""road"" denotes a maritime network linking china to major ports through asia to africa and europe.  it started off with heavy state-driven investment into hard infrastructure abroad. most of the estimated $1tn (£820bn) has been poured into energy and transport projects, such as power plants and railways. beijing touted this as an economic win-win - it told other countries these investments would stimulate development, while at home it sold the bri as a way to help chinese companies, boost the economy and burnish the country's reputation. it had limited success in meeting some goals, such as internationalising the yuan and solving chinese companies' overcapacity. but china reaped a huge economic benefit in trade. a slew of agreements brought access to more resources such as oil, gas and minerals, especially as the bri's focus  widened to include africa, south america and the middle east. about $19.1tn of goods were traded between china and bri countries in the past decade. ""it's about chinese state-owned enterprises going abroad... to help facilitate the flow of resources that china needs,"" said jacob gunter, a senior analyst at the mercator institute for china studies. ""it's also about expanding and developing export markets as alternatives to the liberal developed world."" this diversification has become crucial at a time when china faces greater tensions with the west and their allies.  take soybeans for example. china, the world's biggest importer, used to rely heavily on the us for supplies. but a tariff war with washington forced beijing to turn to south american sources, especially brazil, estimated to be the region's largest recipient of bri funding. gas pipelines from central asia and russia - and oil imports from russia, iraq, brazil and oman - have reduced chinese dependence on japan, south korea and the us, according to the international institute for strategic studies (iiss). having become the lender of first resort for many low or middle income countries through the bri, china is now the world's biggest international creditor.  the true scale of the debt - thought to be at least hundreds of billions of dollars - is unknown. many of the loans, given out by both public and private lenders, are shrouded in secrecy.  now, from sri lanka and the maldives to laos and kenya, countries are struggling with bri debt. this puts the chinese government in a tight spot.  a real estate crisis and liberal borrowing by local governments has already created a ""debt bomb"" domestically - it's estimated to run into trillions of dollars. a sluggish  post-covid economy and record youth unemployment have not helped.  china has restructured bri loans, extended deadlines and forked out an estimated $240bn to help borrowers make payments on time. but it has refused to cancel the debt.  ""for china to simultaneously engage in debt write-downs overseas while domestic economic issues are not fully resolved - it will be politically challenging internally to promote that,"" said christoph nedopil, founding director of the green finance and development center (gfdc), which tracks bri spending.   this has marred beijing's reputation. some critics accuse china of engaging in ""debt trap diplomacy"" by luring poorer countries to sign up for expensive projects so that beijing could eventually seize control of assets put up as collateral. this was the us' accusation over the controversial hambantota port project in sri lanka. many analysts argue there is little evidence of this, but it has heightened fears that beijing is using the bri to undermine others' sovereignty. china has also been criticised over its so-called ""hidden debts"" - governments don't know how exposed their borrowing institutions are, which makes it difficult for countries to weigh up the bri's costs and benefits. over the years bri projects have also been accused of creating wasteful ""white elephants"", fuelling local corruption, exacerbating environmental problems, exploiting workers, and failing to live up to promises of bringing jobs and prosperity to local communities.  one recent study by research lab aid data found more than a third of the projects face such problems. a growing backlash has prompted some countries like malaysia and tanzania to cancel bri deals. read other articles in our series marking 10 years of the bri: ""poor risk management and a lack of attention to detail and cohesion"" from chinese lenders and companies are partly to blame, according to the council on foreign relations. but the think tank and other observers have pointed out the borrowing countries are also to blame, either for rushing into deals without proper planning or mismanaging finances like in the hambantota case. observers also say china gives resources with fewer strings attached, which is less onerous than offers from global lenders or the west. ""china shows up with a 'one-stop shop' approach: 'here are our banks and companies and we do everything from start to finish, and if you sign today we will finish that railway, and it will be done in time just as you campaign for your next election',"" pointed out mr gunter.  ""it's a huge selling point to say that you can do it in one to three years with very little paperwork. maybe it'll be a bit dirty and there may be labour rights violations, but your railway will be done."" yet china has met one of its biggest goals - extending its influence.  it is not just through railways and highways that china has created connections. beijing projects soft power and positions itself as a leader in the global south, paying for thousands of chinese university scholarships, cultural exchange programmes and confucius institutes. the expansion of the brics trading bloc too has been credited to china.  pew research found that in the past decade many middle-income countries have increasingly favourable attitudes towards china, including mexico, argentina, south africa, kenya and nigeria. mr gunter noted that increasingly, countries in the global south do not wish to choose sides in the us-china rivalry. ""china hasn't flipped many countries from a western orientation, but the fact it has moved the needle to a middle ground - that is already a huge diplomatic victory for beijing,"" he said. but observers have also raised concerns of possible economic coercion, where foreign governments feel pressured to follow beijing's agenda or risk china pulling out investment.  one aid data study of chinese state-owned entities' loans to foreign governments found contract clauses that ""potentially allow the lenders to influence debtors' domestic and foreign policies"". in the un, china has ""corralled other states into temporary coalitions"" to oppose measures critical of beijing, while participation in the bri has led several eu members to block or water down policies critical of china, pointed out the iiss. the think tank also said the bri has become one of china's ""main instruments"" in its diplomatic isolation of taiwan. many nations that have shifted recognition from taiwan to china in the past decade are bri funding recipients, it noted. in south east asia, cambodia has consistently resisted condemnation of china's actions in the south china sea, while laos and thailand have been criticised for arresting or allowing the abduction of chinese activists wanted by beijing. china now recognises some things need to change. beijing preaches the mantra of ""small and beautiful"" where, through low-investment, high-yield projects, the bri can have more relevance. examples given by state media include bamboo and rattan-weaving programmes in liberia, biogas technology projects in tonga and samoa, and promoting mushroom-growing technology in fiji, papua new guinea and rwanda. china has also announced a new ""digital silk road"" focused on telecommunication and digital infrastructure. analysts say this would be a more sustainable stream of profits for chinese companies, while lessening the impact of western bans on chinese 5g equipment. with this new strategy, china has cut down financing. it has imposed limits on external lending by chinese banks, and investment deals are now nearly 50% smaller than they were five years ago, according to a gfdc analysis. it has also moved away from being the only creditor in the bri, and started a platform where other countries and international banks can lend money.  but beijing has even grander plans for the bri, which it now touts as the foundation of ""the global community of shared future"". in two white papers released this month, beijing said its form of globalisation would be fairer, more inclusive and less judgmental than the one led by ""hegemonic"" western powers which seek a ""zero-sum game"".  ""the bri is a public road open to all, not a private path owned by any single party,"" it said. far from seeking domination as critics say, china claimed it is ""helping others to succeed while seeking our own success"". the view from china is that ""now globalisation is in danger. the west, in the name of 'de-risking', is actually 'de-china-risking',"" said wang yiwei, a professor who studies the bri at renmin university of china. the main challenge ""is how can the bri build mutual connectivity and avoid a new cold war"".  beijing's trillion-dollar experiment has created a powerful tool to wield influence. but the question is whether the world wants a chinese-led world order.  additional reporting by bbc monitoring.",Neutral

""the focus of (india’s) partnership with the maldives has always been on capacity building and working together to address our shared challenges and priorities, including security challenges and priorities,” said the spokesperson. speaking about the cooperation with the maldives, mea spokesperson arindam bagchi on thursday said, “the assistance and platform that we have provided have contributed significantly in areas like people’s welfare, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and combating illegal maritime activities. over the last five years, more than 500 medical evacuations have been carried out…india has been the first responder for maldives…we look forward to constructively engaging with the incoming administration and discussing ways to enhance our relationship further…”  primary among countries with a stake in the maldives are china and india, and to a lesser degree, pakistan, the uae and saudi arabia. china’s primary goal was to get the maldives on board its belt and road initiative (bri), and in september 2014, former president yameen did just that. the strategic maritime location of the maldives benefits china since it is adjacent to the bri routes used for carrying china's energy supplies. china has been undertaking infrastructure projects and making significant economic investments in the indian ocean region as part of the bri. unlike china, which has provided high-interest credit loans to finance infrastructure projects, india has always helped the maldives to fill its budget deficit with low-interest budget support credit and currency swaps. india has generously provided financial help to the maldives over the years and has been working on some important infrastructure projects in the island nation, said one of the persons cited earlier. experience your economic times newspaper, the digital way! saturday, 04 nov, 2023 read complete epaper  » digital view print view wealth edition apple rings louder: sept qtr sees record revenue in india apple inc set a new quarterly revenue record in india with a strong double-digit year-on-year growth in the september quarter, chief executive tim cook said on friday, adding that the world’s second-largest smartphone market is a key focus for the cupertino, us-based company where it currently has a low share. young & restless driving change at motown’s luxe st luxury car buyers in india are getting younger with two out of five audi buyers aged less than 40. at mercedes-benz india, buyers have an average age of 38 years, the youngest for the german luxury carmaker globally. the scenario is similar at bmw india where consumers aged 35-40 contribute bulk of the sales. sony wants own exec as head of merged co instead of zee’s goenka zee entertainment enterprises ltd (zeel) chief punit goenka’s position as md and ceo of the proposed sony-zee merged entity is on shaky ground as he continues to be under investigation by the securities and exchange board of india (sebi) for the alleged diversion of funds from zeel to promoter entities, people aware of the development told et. read more news on indian military presence china india maldives muizzu & yameen advanced light helicopters (catch all the  business news ,  breaking news  events and  latest news  updates on  the economic times .) download  the economic times news app  to get daily market updates & live business news. ... more less prime exclusives investment ideas stock report plus epaper wealth edition bletchley declaration: key takeaways from world’s first ai safety summit in uk dedicated freight corridors put goods trains on the fast track. but will transportation costs drop? recession or not? it is like a suspense thriller. the climax will decide the fate of global markets. indigo’s blues: why engine troubles can send india’s biggest airline sputtering into turbulence. quick, easy loan is an agent provocateur. are unsecured loans vaulting to a contagion of defaults? ‘jimny is not for volumes’: away from the mass market, maruti takes a road it never travelled before 1 2 3 view all stories",Neutral

mohamed muizzu currently holds the position of mayor in male and enjoys the support of former maldivian president abdulla yameen, who is widely seen as having close ties with china, making him a significant figure in the indian ocean nation. it's worth noting that yameen, who is presently serving a jail sentence, played a crucial role in the indian out campaign, which had garnered substantial attention and support from the opposition. consequences of muizzu's victory several factors appear to have contributed to president solih's defeat. these include perceived failures in combating corruption, a sluggish approach to infrastructure projects, and differences with former president mohamed nasheed. nasheed had previously broken away from the ruling maldivian democratic party (mdp) to establish his own political party. despite last-minute efforts to reconcile solih and nasheed, no agreement was reached, and nasheed chose not to endorse either candidate in the runoff. significance of this development mohamed muizzu had accused president solih of compromising the maldives' independence and sovereignty by seeking india's endorsement for every major decision. shortly after president solih assumed office in 2018, india pledged assistance amounting to $1.4 billion for various projects in the maldives, including the flagship greater male connectivity project. potential implications while muizzu has stated that his government will not hinder projects beneficial to the maldivian people, it raises concerns about the future of the defense and security partnership with india. during his tenure, former president yameen had requested the removal of indian navy helicopters and personnel from the maldives. muizzu has indicated a willingness to take a similar stance. india's involvement in the maldives extends beyond military exercises, maritime domain awareness, and the provision of hardware and infrastructure development. it also encompasses initiatives like the coastal radar system (crs) and the construction of a new defense ministry headquarters in the maldives. in the wake of these developments, the outcome of the maldivian presidential runoff has introduced a new dynamic in the region, impacting india's strategic interests and its relationship with the maldives. the ramifications of this shift will undoubtedly be closely monitored in the coming months. experience your economic times newspaper, the digital way! saturday, 04 nov, 2023 read complete epaper  » digital view print view wealth edition apple rings louder: sept qtr sees record revenue in india apple inc set a new quarterly revenue record in india with a strong double-digit year-on-year growth in the september quarter, chief executive tim cook said on friday, adding that the world’s second-largest smartphone market is a key focus for the cupertino, us-based company where it currently has a low share. young & restless driving change at motown’s luxe st luxury car buyers in india are getting younger with two out of five audi buyers aged less than 40. at mercedes-benz india, buyers have an average age of 38 years, the youngest for the german luxury carmaker globally. the scenario is similar at bmw india where consumers aged 35-40 contribute bulk of the sales. sony wants own exec as head of merged co instead of zee’s goenka zee entertainment enterprises ltd (zeel) chief punit goenka’s position as md and ceo of the proposed sony-zee merged entity is on shaky ground as he continues to be under investigation by the securities and exchange board of india (sebi) for the alleged diversion of funds from zeel to promoter entities, people aware of the development told et. read more news on mohamed muizzu china maldives india maldives president maldives president mohamed muizzu india maldives (catch all the  business news ,  breaking news  events and  latest news  updates on  the economic times .) download  the economic times news app  to get daily market updates & live business news. ... more less prime exclusives investment ideas stock report plus epaper wealth edition bletchley declaration: key takeaways from world’s first ai safety summit in uk dedicated freight corridors put goods trains on the fast track. but will transportation costs drop?

golden eagle assets. the prosecution alleged that this ""business"" was set up to obtain an employment pass in singapore and to manage his own wealth. the police had also seized or frozen liquor, gold and luxury watches from zhang. the prosecution objected to bail for both zhang and lin. zhang's son is studying in japan while his daughter is studying in china. zhang's parents and brothers are usually in china. according to zhang's own accounts, he has about s$41 million in assets overseas, including shareholdings in a philippine real estate development company, bank accounts in china, cash in a chinese trading company and shares bought with funds held in a hong kong bank account. zhang claimed that he has no immovable properties in foreign jurisdictions that he can live in, even if he absconds. he said he held s$93,000 in personal funds held overseas, and this is insufficient to support ""even a basic cost of living for the long term"". he said the remaining value of his overseas assets lie in ""illiquid stock"". the prosecution said the fact remains that he has an incentive to flee singapore where he can live comfortably overseas. in zhang's affidavit, he claimed to be rooted in singapore, having lived here for about four years, and intended to start and raise a family with lin. zhang has known his romantic partner, lin, who calls him ""husband"" although they are not married, for more than 10 years. he has links with other co-accused, including his friendsu haijinand his golf buddysu baolin. he also admitted going on vacations with lin, haijin, baolin and their families - which the prosecution said spoke of the extent of zhang's friendships with other co-accused. the investigating officer in lin's case said she was able to get a passport from dominica after paying an agent us$130,000, and another from cambodia after paying us$160,000 to an agent. she also has passports from turkey and china, and it is not possible for the police to exhaustively determine how many passports she actually has, or to prevent her from obtaining new ones, said the officer. lin wrote in her affidavit that she had travelled to europe and the maldives in july 2022 and april 2023 with zhang, even after being investigated from as early as june 2022. this shows they would not abscond. the prosecution said neither zhang nor lin were charged at that time. lin also has substantial wealth overseas - six residential properties in the united kingdom worth s$10 million and s$1 million worth of residential properties in the philippines. while lin claimed that the philippine properties were in ""extremely poor, unliveable, conditions"", the investigating officer said this does not detract from the fact that the land on which the properties sit carry significant value. investigations indicate that the land was purchased for between 20 million yuan and 30 million yuan, or between s$3.8 million and s$5.7 million. this is far above the combined value of s$1 million that lin claims the properties are worth, said the investigating officer. lawyer chew kei-jin, who took over lin's previous defence lawyer, said the primary rationale for bail is rooted in the premise that an accused person should not be deprived of his personal liberty until he has been convicted and sentenced. he said in the time his client has been remanded, no new charges have been laid against her. zhang's lawyer, mr loo choon chiaw, said his client had no intention of absconding because he ""is not prepared"" to lose the assets seized by cad, which amount to s$110 million. his client has also not attempted to dissipate any of the seized assets even though he had been put on notice more than a year ago that he was a subject of cad's investigations. district judge terence tay ruled that no bail was to be granted to zhang and lin, saying they were flight risks with multiple passports each with the ability to flee the country if released on bail.",Neutral

""it feels great to represent pakistan. but i don't understand where the backlash is coming from. i think it is this idea that i would be parading in a swimsuit in a room full of men,"" ms robin told the bbc.  those criticising her nomination say she is representing a country that does not want to be represented, especially as beauty pageants are rare in muslim-majority pakistan.  miss pakistan world, a pageant for women of pakistani descent from around the world, is probably the most well-known. it was first held in toronto in 2002 but moved to lahore in 2020. the competition has also seen various spin offs such as miss pakistan universal, mrs pakistan universal and even miss trans pakistan.  in the competition's 72-year history, pakistan has never nominated a representative for miss universe. ms robin recalled that during the second selection round of the pageant which was held over zoom, she was asked to name one thing she wanted to do for her country. ""and i replied, i would want to change this mindset that pakistan is a backward country."" this may be difficult, given some of the hostile responses to her nomination.  nevertheless, models, writers and journalists alike congratulated ms robin, with journalist mariana babar hailing her ""beauty and brains"" on x, formerly known as twitter. but as pakistani model vaneeza ahmed, who first encouraged ms robin to get into modelling, told voice of america urdu: ""when these men are fine with international competitions called 'mister pakistan', why do they have a problem with a woman's achievement?"" ""we are a nation of many contradictions and women and the marginalised trigger us the most,"" karachi-based writer and commentator rafay mehmood told the bbc. ""pakistan is at large an authoritarian state and that reflects in the harsh patriarchal values it enables both institutionally and socially. erica robin and the policing she has faced is an extension of that,"" he added.  but there exists an archive of a pakistan that was once far more liberal.  copies of the dawn newspaper from the 1950s to the late 1970s have advertisements of cabaret and foreign belly dancers performing at a club near the former elphinstone street in downtown karachi. these nightclubs were frequented by activists, diplomats, politicians, air hostesses and young people. the historic metropole hotel in karachi was also a favoured spot for singing and jazz performances.  but in 1973, pakistan's parliament created a constitution that declared the country an islamic republic and islam as the state religion.  four years later, military leader general zia ul-haq overthrew the government of prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto. what followed in the decade after has been called  a ""draconian phase"" by activists and lawyers as islamic law was enforced and pakistani society was drastically altered.  by the mid-1980s, general zia had even resurrected public flogging to show his commitment to islamic law.   today, the nightclubs and bars are long gone, and the metropole hotel looks more like it is in danger of collapsing. just down the road, a skeletal structure of what was initially supposed to be a casino stands abandoned.  but the yearning for a freer, more tolerant pakistan has not gone away, and ms robin is just one of those pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not. the graduate of st patrick's high school and government college of commerce and economics, is adamant that she has done nothing wrong.  ""i'm not breaking any law by representing pakistan on a global platform. i am doing my bit to quell any stereotypes about it,"" she said. ",Negative

""the message the arab world is hearing is that palestinian lives matter less than israeli ones,"" he said, adding he was outraged and grieved by acts of violence waged against innocent civilians in gaza, the israeli-occupied west bank, and in israel. france called for a humanitarian corridor into gaza that it said could lead to a cease-fire. britain and germany both urged israel's military to show restraint and italy said it was important to avoid escalation. the united states, israel's closest ally and a vital player in all past peace efforts in the region, sent its cairo charge d'affaires, who did not address the summit in public. limited aid arrives the rafah crossing between the gaza strip and egypt opened saturday morning for the first time since the deadly oct. 7 hamas attack on israel. a convoy of about 20 trucks was able to deliver food, water, medicine, and other necessities to gaza residents. palestinian officials expressed disappointment that gaza did not receive supplies of fuel. ""excluding the fuel from the humanitarian aid means the lives of patients and injured will remain at risk. gaza hospitals are running out of the basic requirements to pursue medical interventions,"" the gaza health ministry said, adding that the aid was only 3% of what it used to get in gaza before the crisis. the united nations has been pressing israel and egypt to allow aid to flow freely into gaza, where hundreds of thousands need assistance after two weeks of bombing and a strict blockade of food and fuel by israel. martin griffiths, the u.n. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said saturday that he is ""confident that this delivery will be the start of a sustainable effort to provide essential supplies - including food, water, medicine and fuel - to the people of gaza, in a safe, dependable, unconditional and unimpeded manner."" the united nations said the life-saving supplies would be received and distributed by the palestinian red crescent, with the consent of hamas, which controls gaza. meanwhile, israel issued a warning advising its citizens against traveling to egypt, jordan and morocco, and if they are in those countries to leave as soon as possible. the warning advises israelis to avoid traveling to any middle eastern countries. it also warned against traveling to malaysia, bangladesh, indonesia and the maldives, countries with large muslim populations. some information for this report came from the associated press, agence france-presse and reuters.

thewar at home, but to it. from athens to new york, they’re rushing to airports and diving into online chat groups for help, desperate to make their way to the country afterhamas militants attacked. some of these israelis abroad are yearning to serve, whether that means fighting in a military reserve unit or volunteering to shuttle supplies to those in need, even as the war has already claimed at least 1,800 lives and shows no signs of abating. on tuesday, israel’s military expanded its mobilization of reservists to 360,000, according to the country’s media, as it ramped up its retaliation for the surprise attacks. yaakov swisa, a 42-year-old father of five, said nobody called and asked him to return to israel to fight, but he feels he has no choice. he served for 15 years, and he said he learned his army roommate was among at least 260 killed at a music festival. read more:five lessons for the u.s. and the world from the hamas invasion of israel swisa wants to rejoin his reserve unit, even if that means leaving his family and his construction-business job in los angeles. “i’ve been crying for two, three days. enough. that’s it. i am ready to fight,” he said. “what else would i do ... while my friends are being buried in israel?” some of the israelis living, working or just traveling abroad who were trying to make it back said their reserve units were among those called up. others said they hadn’t yet been called or couldn’t reach their commanders but expected to be asked soon. in other cases, israelis who are too young to serve in the military, as well as non-israelis with close ties to the country, have been trying to travel to assist family members or volunteer. adam jacobs, an 18-year-old community college student in new jersey, said he was born and raised in the u.s. and for years traveled every summer to visit family in israel. he said he learned his cousin was among those killed, and he wants to make his way to israel to take on volunteer work, possibly shuttling supplies. “i couldn’t live with myself if i stayed here,” jacobs said. “it’s never been this bad.” eric fingerhut, a former u.s. congressman who now leads the jewish federations of north america, said he’s not surprised by how many people want to help. “as soon as we can possibly enable that, we certainly will,” he said from tel aviv, where he’d arrived just before the weekend attacks. “there are many israeli reservists who are abroad. and so getting them back home to join the fight, you know, has been a priority. and it should be a priority. so people are just scrambling.” the war began after hamas militants stormed into israel saturday during a major jewish holiday, killing people and abducting others. in response, israeli warplanes have hammered the gaza strip, destroying buildings and sending palestinian residents scrambling to find safety in the tiny, sealed-off territory. read more:what an israeli ground invasion would mean for gaza travel has been challenging, with major airlines suspending flights in and out of israel. the u.s. state department issued travel advisories for the region. some reservists in the united states, home to more than 140,000 people born in israel, were trying to get on charter flights. ofer cohen, a new york businessman, said he learned there were more than 200 reservists traveling through south america on vacation at the time of the attacks. they’ve been called back to base but unable to get there, thanks to canceled flights. so cohen is trying to cobble together hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire a plane to pick them up, as whatsapp messages describing their troubles keep rolling in. “i just saw one after another,” he said, “and i thought about this idea of getting a charter plane and get them back to israel.” in greece, hundreds of people waited hours to board emergency flights at athens international airport, many without a ticket and most traveling from other european destinations after cutting holiday and work trips short. as officers patrolled the area to provide security, volunteers handed travelers apples, bananas and bottled water. nir ekhouse, a 19-year old from near nazareth, had been in the maldives with family. they reached athens via istanbul as they tried to make it home. once there, ekhouse said, he plans to volunteer for an organization that supports the military. read more:how to help victims of the israel-gaza war “this is the first time in the history of israel that something like that has happened. it’s very shocking,” he said, standing in line

State of Palestine, spea… [+11155 chars]",Maldives,"4 october 2023 the human rights council today held a general debate on its agenda   item seven on the human rights situation in palestine and other occupied   arab territories. state of palestine, speaking as an entity concerned, said it was   regretful that some politicised the work of the council due to the   wishes of the occupying power.  today there were more than six million   refugees from the state of palestine, and thousands of people had been   killed by zionist gangs.  the israeli occupation practices which started   in 1967 were becoming more ferocious and barbaric against the state of   palestine.  all states needed to confront this methodology in light of   the increasing religious zionist powers in israel.  this year   commemorated 56 years of israel as the occupying power.  civilians,   journalists and health workers were being targeted, with 248 people   killed this year, and many administrative detention orders issued.  the   international community needed to shoulder its historic and legal   responsibility to put an end to the occupation. syrian arab republic, speaking as a country concerned, pointed to the   prolonged apartheid-based colonialism that violated all the norms   developed in the field of international human rights and humanitarian   law.  settlement, which was the main feature of the occupation, was   designed to consolidate it and violate the principle of the   inadmissibility of the occupation of territory by force, created by   enabling a coercive environment, including the theft of natural   resources, displacement, intimidation and repression, and the creation   of a geographic situation that prolonged the occupation.  the occupation   of the syrian golan was against international law and tantamount to a   war crime.  the activities in the occupied syrian golan and the occupied   palestinian territory depended on the impunity provided by its main   sponsor, the united states, and other western countries that supported   it and covered up the main crimes. the president of the council noted that israel was not present in the room.in the general debate, some speakers expressed serious concern over   violations of international human rights law in the occupied palestinian   territory.  deprivation of the right to self-determination,   extrajudicial killings, restrictions on freedom of movement and assembly   and illegal settlements were some of glaring manifestations of human   rights violations of the palestinian people.  the situation on the   ground continued to deteriorate, as violations of international law by   israel, the occupying power, and settlers persisted. palestinian civilians, including children, continued to be subjected   to daily and continuous killings, in addition to the policy of   incursions and attacks on palestinian villages, towns and cities by the   israeli occupation forces and settler herds.  speakers were also   concerned about the forced eviction and displacement of many palestinian   families in east jerusalem, which could amount to the war crime of   forcible transfer.  colonisation, confiscations, house demolitions and   forced displacement were illegal under the fourth geneva convention. a number of speakers also expressed grave concern at the continuing   israeli settlement and related activities, including the expansion of   settlements, the expropriation of land, the demolition of houses, and   the confiscation and destruction of property, which had changed the   physical character and demographic composition of the occupied   palestinian territories and the occupied syrian golan.  the occupying   power continued to establish colonial settlements, which aimed to   forcibly replace palestinian landowners with new immigrants, in complete   defiance of international law, in addition to continuing to enact and   legislate more racist colonial laws. some speakers said these actions affirmed that the israeli government   continued to commit the crime of settlement expansion and the deepening   of ""apartheid"", with the aim of closing the door to any opportunity to   materialise a palestinian state on the ground.  they opposed these   settlement activities by the israelis, as well as all projects aimed at   annexing parts of the west bank.  speakers condemned the continuation of   settlement policies and practices in the occupied syrian golan,   including plans announced in late 2021 to establish and expand new   settlements, and the doubling of the number of settlers in the occupied   syrian golan within five years. a number of speakers called for an immediate end of all human rights   violations, including israel's policies aimed at perpetuating the   decades long illegal occupation.  the council and the international   community needed to do more to bring an end to the grave violations of   international human rights and humanitarian laws in the occupied   palestinian territory and hold perpetrators accountable. some speakers urged the office of the high commissioner for human   rights to allocate necessary resources and support to both the   commission of inquiry and the special rapporteur on the situation of   human rights in the occupied palestinian territories.  speakers also   urged the high commissioner to release the annual update of the database   of business enterprises operating in the occupied palestinian   territories, as mandated by resolution 31/36 and 53/25. many speakers emphasised their commitment to strengthening efforts,   including active engagement in international initiatives, aimed at   ending the israeli illegal occupation.  the international community   needed to continue providing political, economic and humanitarian   support to assist the palestinian people and to bolster their resilience   and efforts aimed at achieving their legitimate national aspirations,   including their inalienable right to self-determination and freedom in   their independent state of palestine. a number of speakers rejected the refusal of some states to   participate in the general debate on item seven, as the work of this   item reflected the commitment of the international community to address   israel's long-standing racist practices and policies against the   palestinian people, in accordance with international values and   obligations.  it was important to keep item seven on the agenda of the   council, as it was a vital instrument when it came to documenting   violations against the palestinian people by israel, the occupying   power. some speakers said the allegations directed at israel had been noted   for their perceived bias, with item seven standing as the sole item on   the council's agenda addressed to a specific country.  the council had   been established to promote and protect universal human rights, yet it   had a long legacy of disproportionate focus on israel, exemplified by   the item seven discussion.  the council and the united nations were   continuing a steady drumbeat of demonisation of the world's only jewish   state.  the disproportionate focus, targeting and singling out of   israel, highly discredited the council and the united nations as a   whole.  agenda item seven was ineffective and needed to be removed. a number of speakers said today's session to demonise israel was   simply rhetoric and had a negative impact on jewish communities around   the world.  jews faced continuous verbal and physical anti-semitic   abuse, regularly linked to the israel-palestinian conflict, and were   attacked by perpetrators who used anti-israel rhetoric and called for   the death of the state of israel.  a speaker also drew attention to the   remains of hadar goldin and oron shaul, which were being kept within the   gaza strip, along with hisham al-sayed and avera mengistu, two israeli   civilians with disabilities, who continued to be held in captivity by   palestinian leaders. some speakers echoed their unwavering support for the realisation of   the right to self-determination of the palestinian people and reiterated   the call for ending the israeli occupation.  speakers reaffirmed   support for the two state solution according to the pre-1967 borders,   based on a free and secure state of palestine.  they reaffirmed their   longstanding solidarity with the palestinian people and reiterated their   support for the realisation of their legitimate national aspirations   and inalienable rights, including self-determination and freedom in   their independent state of palestine, with east jerusalem as its   capital. speaking in the discussion were côte d'ivoire on behalf of the   african group, pakistan on behalf of the organization of islamic   cooperation, venezuela on behalf of a group of countries, pakistan on   behalf of a group of countries, azerbaijan on behalf of the non-aligned   movement,  oman on behalf of

""the government hasn't given us any help, not even hope,"" apolonio maldonado told reuters news agency, lifting his feet from the water to show deep red cuts on his shins.  ""they haven't left any food, or even mattresses or cots."" president andrés manuel lópez obrador has promised to help rebuild the city, but has accused his political rivals of exaggerating the extent of the looting to discredit his government before next year's presidential election. ""they circle like vultures, they don't care about people's pain, they want to hurt us, for there to have been lots of deaths,"" he said in a video uploaded to social media.  officials say otis was the most powerful storm to ever hit mexico's pacific coast, leaving a trail of devastation estimated at billions of dollars.

""we settled on mexico or japan for a variety of reasons: ideal climate, potential for our business, cost of living, housing prices, our desire to live more rurally but retain modern amenities,"" she added. ""mexico was obviously much closer. we could drive our car and the cost of living was low enough that we wouldn't be blowing through our savings very quickly while searching for our next home,"" dani said. the couple drove over the border into mexico on december 5, 2021. dani said theimmigration procedures were straightforward— they just needed to file paperwork to extend their temporary residency. the bentons said they spent a little about $1,260 to gain residency in mexico and broke down their costs: us passport renewal for 10 years: $245 temporary visas: $130 temporary resident id cards for one year: $405 immigration lawyer's fees: $380 copies of documents: $100 and they spent about $985 to import their car: car insurance for one year: $440 temporary import permit: $380 internation driver's licenses for one year: $40 ($20 each) dash-cam: $125 (recommended but not required) the couple became house-sitters in mexico so they could live rent-free and travel around the country. dani read about house-sitting online. she said it's common for people to hire house-sitters in mexico when they travel. ""within a few months, we had back-to-back sits booked for the foreseeable future. we could've continued pretty much indefinitely,"" she said. the couple booked about a quarter of their sits throughwww.housesitmexico.com; the remainder came through facebook groups and recommendations from previous hosts. ""our job was to babysit people's pets, collect their mail, and otherwise keep their household running while they were away,"" she said. some house-sits were easy, while others were fairly time-consuming — in one case, they had to take care of 11 rescue dogs and cats. dani said their temporary neighbors and the people they met in mexico were welcoming and friendly. after 14 months in mexico, the couple concluded that japan ""would be a better fit for us."" ""the real kicker was property prices,"" she said. the couple wanted to find a home with arable land to restart their farm business. ""while mexico's cost of living is low, property prices are not ideal. and while japan's cost of living is higher, rural property prices are incredibly low."" evan, who had studied japanese in college and spent a year teaching english in tokyo, was keen to return. they arrived in japan on february 15, on 90-day tourist visas. after 90 days of scouting areas to settle down, they took a ferry to south korea for a week and then returned on another 90-day tourist visa. they eventually purchasedan 'akiya'on the small island of omishima in the ehime prefecture. akiyas are abandoned houses in rural japan. after buying a house, they completed the paperwork that allowed them to get startup business visas.thestartup business visawas only recently introduced for certain parts of japan. the applicants need to provide a plan for their proposed business and can live in japan for up to a year to launch their idea. dani and evan presented their vision for a smallholding business with a number of bee hives producing honey, a guesthouse, and dani's photography it cost the couple $4,450 to complete the paperwork to settle in japan; setting up a company required the assistance of a lawyer and cost $3,600. the house cost $7,500 and the realtor's fees were an additional $1,500. they estimate the diy renovations will cost up to $24,000. over the past seven months, they've been living in and renovating the house. they aim to have it listed on airbnb by november and are optimistic about bookings because the house is near the famous shimanami kaido, a cycling trail of suspension bridges in japan. the couple already have their eye on another nearby abandoned building with surrounding land — listed for less than $19,000 — that they plan to turn into their own home. dani and evan studied beekeeping in louisiana, so they've started a honey business. one of their 10 planned bee colonies is up and running. their goal is to have as many as 50 colonies active in the next four years. ""each colony is approximately $150 plus $100 for initial hive boxes, so for our first 10 hives, that's $2,500,"" she said. ""it's a simplification, but omishima is an island of friendly grandmas and grandpas who were seemingly ready to take us under their wings. no hesitation,"" dani said. ""news spreads fast on a small island, so many people we meet have already heard about the foreign beekeepers moving in. we feel overwhelmingly welcome."" for anyone planning to set up a business in japan, the bentons recommend hiring professionals for all the paperwork. the ""investment is well worth it for sanity, ease, time, and accuracy,"" dani said. both dani and evan admit there are things they miss. ""i miss people from the us,"" dani said.

""we have stated many times that we adhere to the process of   negotiations for a responsible return of all parties to the jcpoa,"" he   said. he further noted that tehran has been engaged in indirect talks with   washington and that some friendly countries have also offered their   initiatives to bring the parties' views closer to each other. ""the agreement in our mind is the jcpoa of 2015, under which iran   fulfilled its commitments, but unfortunately, europe and the united   states turned their backs and the united states unilaterally withdrew   from it,"" said kanaani. he also referred to oman's initiative to bring the parities' views   closer to one another and return all parties to their commitments,   saying iran welcomes the good-faith efforts of friendly countries in   this regard. ""if the other side has the will to responsibly return to the jcpoa,   iran is also ready to help in this direction, and we adhere to the   diplomatic process for an agreement,"" the foreign ministry spokesman   said. he hastened to add, ""at the same time, we do not tie our diplomatic   efforts to the jcpoa and an agreement (to revive it), but we will also   follow the path of neutralization of sanctions."" visit of armenian security official to iran elsewhere in his remarks, the spokesman referred to the recent visit   of the secretary of the national security council of armenia armen   grigoryan to iran and said such a visit took place in line with the   continuation of talks and contacts between the two neighboring countries   to review the bilateral relations and the developments in the caucasus   region. kanaani noted that such a visit was an opportunity for the islamic   republic to express its viewpoints about the solution for solving the   conflicts in the caucasus region through regional potentials. as the spokesman underlined, the islamic republic attaches importance   to the conditions of caucasus and of course the entire region, and the   visit of the armenian official to iran took place to discuss those   conditions. he went on to say that tehran welcomes the removal of conflicts   between baku and yerevan, stressing that iran is against any change in   the international and geopolitical borders. on the latest remarks made by iranian foreign minister hossein   amirabdollahian about the zangezur corridor, he said the islamic   republic is after the development of the transportation networks which   will secure the benefits of all regional countries; meanwhile, the   country is against changes in the international borders. about the disputed nagorno-karabakh region between armenia and   azerbaijan, kanaani said iran supports full return of this occupied   region to azerbaijan. iran is ready to carry out whatever it can to solve the issue of caucasus, he added. asked about iran's plan for taking humanitarian measures towards   armenians who have forcibly moved from the nagorno-karabakh region, the   spokesman answered that the details about such a plan will be released   by the iranian red crescent society. an official from the republic of azerbaijan is set to visit iran,   kanaani said, adding that the exact date of the visit will be announced   in due course. he also said that in addition to the planned visit, bilateral   discussions are currently underway on a range of issues, noting that key   among these is the resumption of operations at the azerbaijani embassy   in tehran and the developments in the caucasus region. iran-iraq security agreement as to a security agreement between iran and iraq, kanaani noted that   in accordance with the security agreement the iraqi authorities and the   local government in the kurdistan region of iraq are expected to meet   iran's concerns regarding the presence of terrorist groups in the   northern region via disarming and relocating them to arranged positions   within six months. the deadline came to an end on september 19, he argued, adding that   on the basis of iran's assessment, certain provisions of the agreement   have been implemented while others still should be carried out. the spokesman also said that an iranian delegation visited iraq to   conduct a field investigation into the implementation of the security   agreement and that the iraqi authorities cooperated with the iranian   representatives very properly. a precise assessment of the issue will be shared with the iraqi side   following the presentation of the field investigation report by the   iranian supervisory committee, he added. in the discussions between the iranian and the iraqi sides, both   baghdad authorities and the officials in the kurdistan region of iraq   emphasized that they are obligated to implement the security agreement,   kanaani said. the iraqis stated that a great number of the headquarters of   terrorist groups have been evacuated and the terrorists have been   disarmed and moved into the depths of iraqi territory; moreover, some of   their hideouts have been completely demolished, while the rest of   headquarters are set to be destroyed, he added. according to the spokesman, in anticipation of the implementation of   the security agreement, iran and iraq continue communication and   cooperation, and the islamic republic has time and again underscored it   knows no boundary in securing the country's borders. relations with arab countries in his remarks, the spokesman elaborated on why the foreign   ministerial meeting between the persian gulf littoral states was not   held in new york on the sidelines of the annual session of the united   nations general assembly on september 18 to 26, the spokesman said   although iran had welcomed such a meeting and there was a public   welcome, it was not held due to some political conflicts between two or   more littoral countries in the persian gulf region. about the situation of relations between iran and jordan, kanaani   said the foreign ministers of the two countries did meet in new york and   agree to take steps towards upgrading the level of diplomatic ties. about the resumption of relations between iran and djibouti and   maldives, the spokesman said positive steps have been taken towards the   islamic republic and the two mentioned states after release of joint   statement on the issue. kanaani, elsewhere, talked of the latest situation of relations   between iran and sudan, saying that the country is willing to resume   relations with sudan and there is a positive viewpoint from khartoum on   the issue. iran's relations with sudan is promising, the spokesman further noted. release of nationals jailed abroad asked about the continuation of the exchange of prisoners with the   united states, kanaani said there is no plan for the exchange of   prisoners between the two countries now, but the issue of pursuing the   release of iranian prisoners in different countries, including the us,   is high on the agenda of the iranian administration. ""we follow this issue in the form of our consular support for iranian   nationals,"" he said, adding that releasing iranian nationals who have   been imprisoned on trumped-up political charges in western countries is   among iran's priorities. the issue was raised by foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian with   the officials of european countries on the sidelines of the latest   summit of the united nations general assembly, he remarked. on media speculations about iran's accession to the financial action task force (fatf), kanaani said he was not awarewhether iran had such a plan, but added that the country has certain mechanisms for financial transparency. illegal us presence in syria elsewhere during the presser, the spokesman clarified iran's position   on the presence of american forces in syria, saying the us government   cannot be in the arab country without the permission of the syrian   government. ""this is regarded as a violation of the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of syria,"" he pointed out. he further condemned us actions in syria, which he said suggested   that washington pursues the disintegration of the war-torn country.   ""they must end their illegal presence in syria,"" he added. us-iran policy on the annual report of the united states regarding weapons of mass   destruction and allegations against iran, kanaani said that such   accusations are totally unfounded and that iran is a loyal member state   of the non-proliferation treaty (npt), which signed the additional   protocol agreement in cooperation with the international atomic energy   agency (iaea) and it is implementing it. according to the spokesman,   iran has time and again announced that nuclear weapons are not included   in its military doctrine; so, it considers the usage of such weapons of   mass destruction unacceptable. we categorically reject the annual report of the us and consider it   as invalid, he noted, arguing that the secretariat of the iaea is the   only authorized organization responsible for reviewing the membership of   member states; so, the united states does not have the authority to   evaluate the compliance of other nations. in contradiction with the groundless anti-iran allegations leveled by   the united states, it is the us administration that deserves   condemnation for setting up illegal laboratories around the globe and it   should be held accountable to the international community, the   spokesman said, adding that the united states resorts to blame game in a   bid to accuse iran fallaciously. as to direct talks with the united states, kanaani stated that we deny holding any direct negotiations with the americans. he also said that iran will not cede its rights to return the achaemenid tablets from the united states to the islamic country. the spokesman also mentioned that the iranian administration returned   a part of the collection of the achaemenid tablets at the end of   president ebrahim raisi's visit to new york and that the tablets were   part of a collection that was at the university of chicago. he went on to say that fortunately, the exemption permission for the   shipment of the iranian properties has been obtained so far and that   17,000 other tablets are still in possession of the oriental institute   of the university of chicago; so, negotiations are underway for their   return. iran would not stop efforts in this respect, and it pursues   proper agendas to complete the process. quran desecration in sweden regarding the recurring desecration of the holy quran in sweden,   kanaani said amirabdollahian raised the issue, including the   expectations of the muslim world from the swedish government, in a   recent meeting with his swedish counterpart in new york. the foreign minister also noted that the swedish government is   responsible for preventing insults to the quran and the values of two   billion muslims, he added. visa cancellation with saudi arabia asked about visa cancellation plans with saudi arabia, the spokesman   said the foreign ministry is examining plans for cancellation of visas   with some countries, including saudi arabia. ""there are several plans and ideas, and meetings have been held with relevant organizations,"" he said. positive developments in iran-egypt ties kanani further pointed to the iran-egypt relationship, saying that as   a result of the positive developments in the region, we have also   witnessed positive developments concerning the relations between iran   and egypt, including the talks between the two countries and a meeting   between their foreign ministers in new york on the sidelines of the 78th   un general assembly. he expressed hope that complementary steps would pave the ground for establishing a new atmosphere between tehran and cairo. the spokesman also referred to allegations about connections between   some us officials and iran's foreign ministry concerning the jcpoa,   arguing that we are not keen on commenting on internal affairs of the us   and the competition underway among american parties because it can pave   the way for some people to play with iran card; thus, we leave the   issue to the us parties. 4354**1483**4208**7129  ",Neutral

… [+6132 chars]",Mexico,"fossilized human footprints at white sands national park in new mexico are every bit as old as the 23,000 years-and-change they were dated at in 2021, according to new analysis published in science. back in 2021, researchers published work in which they used radiocarbon dating of crushed seeds of ruppia cirrhosa, an aquatic grass, to date the preserved footprints to between 23,000 and 21,000 years old, which would make them thousands of years older than the next most recent evidence of humans in north america. that finding was exciting, but scientists looked for a way to be more certain of the prints’ age. now, they’ve done it: a group, including members of the previous collaboration, has dated pollen and sediments from the site to the same timeframe as the ancient grasses. footprints are a telltale sign of a hominin presence, if not homo sapiens. in 2020, a team found fossilized footprints in saudi arabia that they said could belong to our species and which date to about 120,000 years ago. if they were made by homo sapiens, the trackways could reveal one route out of africa for our ancestors. but the prints could also have belonged to neanderthals, whose oldest confirmed footprints date to just over 100,000 years ago and were spotted on a spanish beach in 2020. but the white sands footprints are arguably more controversial than the prints from the middle east and europe. these belonged to a group of humans that likely included teenagers and children, based on their sizes, who were probably moving across the land at a typical walking pace. proboscidean (mammoth or mastodon) and dire wolf prints are also on the site. as jeanne timmons reported for gizmodo in 2021, when the prints were first dated: it’s a stunning revelation that indicates humans lived in areas below the ice sheets covering much of north america and the world at that time, evidence that could change our understanding of when people arrived on this continent, where they migrated, how they impacted the ecosystem, and how they responded to climate change. “we always knew that we would have to independently evaluate the accuracy of our ages to convince the archaeological community that the peopling of the americas occurred far earlier than traditionally thought,” said study lead author jeffrey pigati, a geologist with the u.s. geological survey, in an american association for the advancement of science release. there are several hypotheses for when humankind first appeared in north america. one view is that our species didn’t arrive until after the last glacial maximum (lgm), between 16,000 and 14,000 years ago, when the frigidness of the pleistocene finally began to thaw, giving way to the holocene epoch. the idea is that glaciers would have impeded human expansion across the continent—during the lgm, about 25% of earth’s land was covered in ice. but the white sands footprints, if dated correctly, clearly indicate that homo sapiens were in the american southwest before the ice sheets began to recede. “although we were confident in the original seed ages, we wanted to develop community confidence in them as well,” said kathleen springer, also a geologist with the usgs, in the same release. “our new ages, combined with the strong geologic, hydrologic, and stratigraphic evidence, unequivocally support the conclusion that humans were present in north america during the last glacial maximum.” radiocarbon dating is a reliable way of dating ancient organic material, but it has shortcomings. aquatic plants can photosynthesize atmospheric carbon that’s made its way into the water, but they can also take up more ancient carbon from the groundwater, meaning that analyzing the plant remnants with radiocarbon dating can yield an older age than what the plants actually are. this is known as the freshwater reservoir effect. additionally, the plants themselves may be more ancient than the sediments they’re found in, if they were redeposited in younger geological layers. in the new research, the team radiocarbon dated pollen from the same layers as the ruppia seeds. pollen is not affected by the freshwater reservoir effect. the team also conducted optically stimulated luminescence dating of the sediment, which dates layers of the ground by determining when some minerals in the soil were last exposed to light (i.e. when they were last on the surface). “the interpretation of the results seems sound,” rainer grun, a geochronologist and former director the australian research centre for human evolution, in an email to gizmodo. “the good agreement between the seed and pollen results refute the argument of reworking of the seeds.” the pollen dates ranged from 23,400 years ago ± 2,500 years to  22,600 years ago ± 2,300 years; the sediment dating yielded a minimum age of 21,500 years old ± 1,900 years. in other words, two additional lines of evidence to the radiocarbon dating of the ruppia plant material corroborate the team’s initial findings two years ago. “even allowing for substantial errors in radiocarbon dating and osl, the data overall from the pigati et al. study strongly indicate human presence in the americas around the lgm,” wrote bente philippsen, an archaeologist at the national laboratory for age determination at the norwegian university of science and technology, in a related perspectives article. older dates have been posited for a human presence in north america. in 2017, a team of researchers suggested there was evidence of human activity on the continent a staggering 130,000 years ago, a claim that received widespread pushback. in 2020, two studies in nature described stone tools and flakes in a mexican cave that were dated to about 31,000 years old, and last year, an apparent mammoth butchery site in new mexico was dated to about 37,000 years old—15,000 years older than the white sands footprints. trace fossils provide a different, more intimate window into the past than bones or teeth. a collection of footprints show not just that people were present, but how many there were, whether they were children or adults, and where they were going. superlative age aside, the white sands footprints are a marvelous echo of some of the earliest americans. at least, some of the earliest we know of for now. more: archaeologists discover 29 human footprints from the last ice age",Neutral

""i asked for water and a guard responded, 'you want it, give me 500 pesos,'"" the migrant from el salvador recalls. that's about $30. to migrants' demands for water, another guard said, ""go back to your own country and complain there."" the salvadoran man went on to survive one of thedeadliest eventsinvolving migrants near the mexico-u.s. border: on march 28, a fire at the ciudad juárez migrant detention center killed 40 people and injured 27. this man's account of what happened in the crowded facility, and his experiences that followed, depicts inhumane treatment by the national migration institute, mexico's migration enforcement arm. and experts say the agency has failed to reform abusive practices. these conditions have worsened, migrant advocates say, as the united states continues relying on mexico and other parts of latin america to help curb the influx of migrants at its border. in an interview in mexico city, the survivor asked npr not to use his name because he fears retribution in both mexico and el salvador. he and his two cousins had left their home country about a week before the fire. he says they were fleeing the salvadoran government'scontroversial anti-gang strategy, which has jailed 70,000 people without a trial. human rights groups say the arrests of juveniles and adult men have been indiscriminate. family and friends encouraged the three men to leave el salvador after seeing arrests of people they believed had no affiliation with gangs. after making their way through central america and mexico, they crossed into the united states illegally early in the hours of march 27. but the migrant saysthey never got a chance to explain why they had to leave el salvador or ask for asylum: u.s. officials immediately expelled them back to mexico under a trump-era policy known as title 42. the biden administration continued using title 42, but the policy gotheld upinthe courtslast year, and eventuallyended this past may. the three salvadorans quickly landed in the mexican makeshift detention center near the border. the survivor says tensions grew as 67 migrant men were packed into one cell, while 15 women were in another, in a facility with an official capacity of 60.an official — who this migrant suspected was higher up because of his more formal uniform — arrived to try to resolve the situation, he says. but it only got worse. a venezuelan migrant, from this survivor's memory, threatened to light one of the foam sleeping mats on fire unless the guards gave them water and told them what was going to happen to them. ""if you were gonna do it, you'd have already done it by now,"" the migrant recalls the official responding. soon, the salvadoran man saw a sleeping pad on fire. ""that's when i got really scared,"" he says. he and his cousins ran toward the back of the cell, as far as they could get from the fire. the flames grew and smoke filled the cell. fellow migrants searched frantically for an exit but there was no way out. he lost sight of his cousins in the commotion. ""i inhaled smoke,"" he says. ""i felt my insides burning."" and then everything went dark. securityfootage later showedthat as the fire grew, guards did not open the gate. a lawyer alleged that a senior official told guardsnot to open the cellwhen the fire started. ten people have since been criminally charged over the deaths of 40 migrants and injuries of another 27. six of the accused are subcontracted security guards or officials from mexico's national migration institute. guards have been charged with homicide. the agency'scommissioner, francisco garduño yáñez, and another senior official have been charged with failure to perform public duties, with prosecutors alleging they were responsible for ensuring the detention center was safe. two venezuelan migrants who allegedly started the fire were alsocharged with murder. commissioner garduño, who remains in his post, has denied responsibility for the fire. a survivor's scars from the fire at the immigration detention center of the national migration institute in ciudad juárez, mexico.james fredrick for nprhide caption hours after the fire, six survivors in critical condition were airlifted to hospitals in the mexican capital. one died days later. having blacked out during the fire, the salvadoran migrant eventually woke up confused under bright lights. he couldn't move. there was a tube down his throat. doctors explained he was in mexico city and had been in a coma for the last month. he had serious damage to his lungs and one kidney, and had third-degree burns on his arms and back. ""my mother was there and i cried when i saw her,"" he says. she had been granted a special visa to be with her son in mexico. she was overjoyed to see him open his eyes, but she had bad news: his two cousins had died in the fire. ""only god knows why i was left alive,"" he says through tears. he gave a statement to state prosecutors investigating the case. as he began his recovery, regaining strength in his legs and lungs that would allow him to walk again, something strange was happening. ""it was migration agents driving me everywhere, in the same"" armored vans used to transport detained migrants, he says. they drove him between public hospitals where he was being treated and a hotel, where they were paying for lodging for the fire survivors. after major human rights violations occur, experts say, mexico's executive commission for victim assistance provides services to handle medical, psychological, financial and other survivors' needs. it is traumatizing for victims to have to face every day the institution that left them locked in the cell to die. lorena cano, human rights lawyer in mexico government agencies blamed for the rights violations — in this case, the national migration institute — are supposed to cover these costs but not have direct contact with victims while criminal investigations are ongoing. ""what's happening with the ciudad juárez survivors is very unusual,"" says lorena cano, a lawyer with the nonprofit women in migration institute. the group represents migrants (mostly women and children but also men) who have been victims of crimes. despite the criminal charges, the mexican government has not officially recognized any of the survivors as victims under the law, which would give them and their families the right to government support. when she noticed the unusual procedures, cano sought out victims in mexico city hospitals to offer them representation to guarantee their access to government support. ""the victims' commission and the national human rights commission have been asleep on the job,"" she says, adding that they have had virtually no contact with human rights lawyers or victims. instead, the national migration institute has unofficially taken control of the victims and survivors' families. according to cano and other human rights lawyers consulted by npr, there has never been a case of the agencyaccused of crimes like this directly involved in the care of victims of its alleged crimes. ""it is traumatizing for victims to have to face every day the institution that left them locked in the cell to die,"" she says. the national migration institute, the victims' commission and the human rights commission did not respond to npr's questions. commissioner garduño told reports in may he couldsleep peacefullyafter the fire because he was ""1,800 kilometers away when it happened"" and therefore couldn't have changed anything. cano says the mexican government has tried to prevent human rights lawyers from contacting survivors and families of the deceased. instead, she has worked with the venezuelan, honduran and salvadoran consulates to contact victims. she's representing eight survivors. ""we suspect that what the administration wants is to reduce the political impact of this tragedy and close the case as quickly as possible,"" she says. cano claims the government has created an environment in which migrant survivors of the fire will continue to feel unsafe or unprotected in mexico, and will choose to try to go to the u.s. or return to their home country. a view of the migrant detention center where at least 39 people died due to a fire, in ciudad juárez, mexico, on march 28.christian thompson/anadolu agency via getty imageshide caption a view of the migrant detention center where at least 39 people died due to a fire, in ciudad juárez, mexico, on march 28. mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador has an inconsistent track record on migration, critics say. he has recently said the world has taken the""wrong approach""with militarized migration deterrence. ""causes must be addressed, we must go to the roots, to drop the politics and think about rights above ideology,"" he says. however, lópez obrador at times has deployed nearly30,000 national guard troopsin addition to migration agents to stop migrants going toward the u.s. on the ground,migrants' reportto human rights groups frequent robbery, extortion and kidnappings by mexican officials, including migration agents and soldiers. additionally, lópez obrador's appointment of garduño — a former federal prisons chief — and refusal to dismiss him after the fire have generated controversy, especially after the president called him ""upright and hardworking."" ""what we're seeing is scandalous,"" says emilio álvarez icaza, a senator who is on the congressional oversight committee monitoring developments from the ciudad juárez fire. ""[garduño] has refused to resign and has instead petitioned a judge to drop the criminal charge and find a friendly solution."" to have his charge dropped, garduñotold reportersoutside a courtroom that he offered to personally pay to repair the burned building but did not offer to compensate victims. instead, the commissioner publicly announced the compensation victims' families could expect to receive from the mexican government, approximately $70,000 each on average, even though he does not have the legal authority over the government's compensation of victims. the victims' commission later confirmed this amount. garduño's statements are meant to demonstrate the agency's speedy, generous compensation of victims, analysts say, but go against government procedure — and may have a perverse effect. ""victims are from countries with high rates of crime and many were fleeing persecution, so publicly announcing large compensation sums can put them and their families at huge risk,"" says cano. ""it's completely unforgivable."" on wednesday, mexican interior secretary maría luisa alcaldesaidthe government was preparing ""comprehensive restitution"" for victims and defended garduño's leadership on immigration, saying mexico respects the presumption of innocence. cano and álvarez both claim garduño's actions are the sign of an agency unwilling to reform or be transparent. ""this isn't just about giving victims money, it's about making sure this doesn't happen again,"" cano says. ""sadly, detention centers have long been like this, completely inhumane."" in 2020, migrantslit sleeping pads on firein protest over covid conditions at a detention center in tenosique, near mexico's southern border with guatemala. one migrant died and 14 were injured. ""how the hell did they not put measures in place after this?"" asks cano. ""the fire in ciudad juárez never should have been able to happen."" this happened because [president] lópez obrador decided to accept the pressure from the trump and now biden administrations to contain migrants, and in turn, the government systematically abuses them. emilio álvarez icaza, mexican senator cano says the migration institute has long ignored calls from civil society and theunited nations to reformdetention conditions. senator álvarez says the problems run deeper. ""this didn't happen just because a guard didn't open the gate,"" the lawmaker says. ""this happened because lópez obrador decided to accept thepressure from the trumpand now biden administrations to contain migrants, and in turn, the government systematically abuses them."" mexican and u.s. immigration officials met on sept. 22 todiscuss joint migration deterrence efforts, one of dozens of high-level migration meetings between the two countries in recent years. in june, u.s. ambassador to mexico ken salazartoured migration facilitiesin southern mexico with the indicted garduño and called mexico ""a crucial partner"" on migration. ""mexico is living through a tremendoushuman rights crisisand migration is a key part of that,"" says álvarez. of the eight survivors cano is representing, four have left mexico and been granted humanitarian parole in the united states, including the salvadoran man who lost two cousins.

conversation withalyssa pfennig, 43, who moved from indiana to mexico in 2021. the following has been edited for length and clarity. i'd wanted to live abroad my entire life. as a single mother of a 4-year-old from indiana who lived in indianapolis for 38 years, i also wondered whether i could have a better quality of life in a country less expensive than the us. since i domuch of my work remotely, i figured i could work and live anywhere. i was mostly drawn to the idea of living in mexico because i had visited a few times and liked its proximity to the us, culture, food, traditions, and language. i've now lived in mexico for over two years, and my quality of life has drastically improved. here's how i made the move and how it's benefited my daughter and me. i hired a relocation consultant whom i found on the internet for about $500 to help me determine the best place for us to live and what we needed to do to make it happen, including how to move my dog and items across the border. she also provided information on how much to budget and medical resources, recommended stores and schools, gave an overview of neighborhoods, and offered referrals to a real-estate agent, immigration lawyer, and insurance broker. the relocation consultant and i discussed options including todos santos and puerto vallarta. after i decided that i wanted to live somewhere with year-round mild weather, she recommended san miguel de allende. that summer, my daughter and i took a 10-day trip there, and i knew it was where i wanted to move. everything was easy from the moment we arrived. we found our first nanny from a referral in a facebook group, and the owner of our rental house referred us to another nanny. her sister cooked for us, and her other sister helped on the weekends so i could enjoy a working vacation. their family is still part of ours. i even met a taxi driver on our scouting visit who would wait for us while we looked at homes. he still honks and says hello when he sees me walk by now that we live here. my relocation consultant recommended not signing a lease in mexico without seeing the property first, so when we moved down, we found a place to stay for just a few weeks. i realized it was too far outside the city, and i felt isolated, so i picked another place near the city center, in colonia san antonio, that felt more upbeat and signed a lease there. i hired an immigration lawyer to help me with residency, which made the process so much easier. i attempted the traditional process, but because i had traveled to mexico before 2020, i was eligible for aspecial programthat would grant me four years oftemporary residency. i moved on a tourist visa and applied for temporary residency once the tourist visa expired. we secured mine first and later added my daughter as family. a big reason i was eager to move was that i knew i could make the same amount of money working remotely but save more and stress less about mycost of living. i moved into a brand-new 1,500-square-foot loft apartment with a giant terrace and balcony overlooking the city center — it costs $750 a month. in indiana, my apartment was smaller and not as nice or luxurious, but it cost me $1,500 a month. i pay a nanny $5.50 an hour, a fair wage here, for daily childcare while i work. there arelabor lawsin mexico that protect her, my nanny has paid holidays and an annual bonus, and i give her a raise every year. in indiana, i paidbetween $18 and $25 an hourfor a nanny. i can also afford luxuries that i never could before, including a housekeeper whom i pay $25 to clean my house each week — compared with the $125 i paid on average in the us — and a cook who costs $33 each visit and provides us with a few days' worth of meals. these rates are also fair for my area. when i moved here, the hardest part was figuring out how to take the bus, where to buy groceries, where to buy food for my dog with allergies, how to call the best taxi service, and how to get water delivered. i had a good base of spanish that i picked up from friends in college. once we arrived, i took online classes, used google translate, and learned the language faster than i thought i would just by communicating with my nanny daily. we assimilated well and got to know our neighbors. i also made new friends, including some other expatriates. i've especially connected with parents here who have children of a similar age. my parents and family still live in indiana and we visit at least once per year because i do miss them. i still have a lot of friends whom i also visit when i'm in indiana, and we stay connected on social media, too. i feel like i have a life now beyond running a business and being a mother. i work about 20 hours a week or less by hiring part-time freelancers who take on work that doesn't require my immediate attention. i use my free time to focus on hobbies that i love, from tango dancing to going on long midweek hikes, and i have a lot of time to spend with my daughter. the people i've met here don't live or work with a sense of urgency like people i knew in the us did. for example, if someone here says they'll deliver something ""ahorita,"" or right now, that can mean immediately or, say, five hours, which took some getting used to. fireworks also go off almost every night around where i live for many different reasons, such ascelebrating a saint or holidayor commemorating someone who died. i hear them sometimes at 4 or 5 in the morning, but i've learned to deal with it. i was told that mexico would either chew you up and spit you out or embrace you with open arms. the latter was true for me. i'm happy i moved here because life is easier and better than i ever could have imagined.",Positive

""we firmly oppose the united states' sanction and prosecution against chinese entities and individuals, and the severe infringement of the lawful rights and interests of the relevant enterprises and persons,"" the chinese foreign ministry told afp news agency. ""the chinese government has been strictly cracking down on drug crimes... and we deploy the harshest control on precursor chemicals.  ""imposing pressure and sanctions cannot solve the united states' own problems. it will only create obstacles in the china-us co-operation on drug control,"" it said.  in april, a spokesperson for the chinese foreign ministry said there was ""no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl"" between china and mexico. this came after mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador called on the chinese government to help stop the alleged flow of fentanyl and its precursors into his country.  the us authorities blame mexican drug gangs for supplying fentanyl to users across the us. fentanyl can be legally prescribed by doctors, but a dramatic increase in opioid addiction in the us in recent decades has led to a rise in illegal production and overdoses. in 2022, the drug was linked to a record 109,680 deaths. the us treasury department announced sanctions against what it called a ""china-based network responsible for the manufacturing and distribution"" of precursors of fentanyl and a number of other illegal drugs.  officials say companies in the fentanyl supply chain routinely use false addresses and mislabelling to avoid their products being identified by law enforcement. those affected by the sanctions include 12 entities and 13 individuals based in china, as well as two entities and one individual based in canada, the treasury said. the sanctions will freeze the entities' us assets and bar americans from dealing with them. merrick garland is due to travel to mexico with other senior officials for meetings on how to tackle the supply of illegal drugs.  ""we know who is responsible for poisoning the american people with fentanyl,"" mr garland told reporters. ""we know that this network includes the cartels' leaders, their drug traffickers, their money launderers, their clandestine lab operators, their security forces, their weapons suppliers, and their chemical suppliers.  ""and we know that this global fentanyl supply chain, which ends with the deaths of americans, often starts with chemical companies in china."" the us justice department has also unsealed indictments charging eight chinese companies and 12 of their employees with crimes related to fentanyl and methamphetamine production, the distribution of opioids and sales resulting from precursor chemicals. no-one has been arrested and the chinese government did not work with us authorities on the investigations, mr garland said.",Negative

""that seems to be what they're thinking about with this proposal.""  the term ""wall"" itself is a misnomer. on its website, customs and border patrol describes the border barrier as including everything from picket fences to concrete and steel levees and, in places, ""normandy barriers"" - large metal barricades solely designed to stop vehicle intrusions, but passable for people on foot.  according to cbp, the new wall construction will consist of 18-foot (5.4m) steel fence panels placed in portable concrete barriers, bolstered by ""detection technology"" and lighting.  experts note that even sectors with tall, solid barriers are by no means impenetrable. migrants often find ways to climb the barriers using ladders or ropes or cut and climb through them.  ""it's really just more of a speed bump. it'll probably just take another few minutes to get into the us,"" said adam isacson, a researcher at the washington office on latin america.  ""this is not at all an insurmountable barrier. it's harder to get kids over, or the old or disabled, and a lot more people die or are badly injured falling from it. but it does not seem to deter people"".  walls, mr isaacson added, are also ""irrelevant if your goal is to turn yourself in"" and formally seek asylum - which in recent months has constituted a ""significant majority"" of the total number of migrant detentions. once across the international boundary, asylum seekers are legally permitted to challenge deportation.  along the border - where communities are long used to being at the frontlines of the immigration debate - news of the border extension has elicited mixed feelings.  several residents of border towns told the bbc that while they want a strong border they are opposed to a wall, or that they are open to the idea but are concerned about how it is implemented. one of them, eagle pass activist jessie fuentes, said that he ""fought hard"" against previous border wall construction efforts, but ultimately felt that the barriers were ""well engineered"" and ""set up strategically"".  ""fences serve a purpose,"" he said. ""if it's going to help cbp control or set up a route where migrants can find shelter or relief, then that's a good thing....but it shouldn't make people think we're walling off everything. it's a tough one."" alex garcia, a resident of webb county - which neighbours starr county - said that he ""understands"" the need for a barrier but is worried for the environmental impact and the fact that migrants ""could hurt themselves"" attempting to cross.  as a concept, border ""walls"" pre-date both president biden and former president trump. every recent us president has built or enhanced portions of barriers along the border, including 128 miles constructed during the obama administration. these barriers, experts note, have had little long-term impact on the migration flows and triggers that ultimately determine how many migrants arrive at the us-mexico border.  arturo sarukhan, who served as mexico's ambassador to the us between 2007 and 2013, said that ""you can't enforce your way out of a migration crisis"" regardless of ""red-meat politicking and dog-whistle narratives"" or a ""need to neutralise electoral pimping of the issue"".  ""you can't tackle 21st century challenges with 1st century bce solutions,"" he said. ""the only effect this will have is to further drive up profits for organized crime smuggling and trafficking people and play whack-a-mole with migration flows and crossing patterns into the us towards more perilous routes and border regions"".

How long have humans lived on the American conti… [+5206 chars]",Mexico,"scientists studying fossil human footprints in new mexico say their age implies that humans arrived in north america earlier than thought.nps photohide caption scientists studying fossil human footprints in new mexico say their age implies that humans arrived in north america earlier than thought. how long have humans lived on the american continent? for decades, one prevailing answer was perhaps 14,000 years, based largely on the age of early human stone tools known as clovis points, first discovered in clovis, nm. but a new analysis of fossilized human footprints adds weight to the case for a longer human history in the americas. the footprints are among thousands made by humans, mammoths, giant sloths and others in white sands national park, an ethereal landscape in southern new mexico where waves of white gypsum dunes lap across the vast tularosa basin. that basin held a lake during the last ice age, and its dried-out banks preserve the prints. in 2021, researchers from the national park service, the u.s. geological survey and others publisheda paper in the journal sciencesaying those footprints were between 21,000 and 23,000 years old. that was controversial. ""these ages were really much older than the accepted paradigm of when humans entered north america,"" said kathleen springer, one of the us geological survey researchers who wrote the report. she says scientists had thought humans might have crossed from what is now siberia to alaska toward the end of the last ice age. but if her team's analysis of the footprints was correct, maybe that was wrong, and humans found a way onto the continent even when its northern lands were still ice-bound. ""it opens up whole avenues of migratory pathways,"" she said. ""how did people get here?"" the overlapping tracks – and timeline – of humans and megafauna also opened new questions about how long the species coexisted, and what role humans might or might not have played in their extinction. critics challenged the research. another paper published in science said the dating technique used was flawed: the scientists had carbon-dated seeds fromruppia cirrhosa, a grasslike aquatic plant that lives in lakes and that was embedded along with the footprints. but aquatic plants can absorb older carbon from water, skewing the results. so, after some pandemic-related delays, the researchers returned to the excavation site, this time to carbon-date tree pollen, for better accuracy. also, they took samples of the lake bed. ""they're like tubes pounded in the sedimentary sequence and taken back to a laboratory and analyzed,"" said springer. for those samples they used a different technique called optically stimulated luminescence. it looks at the luminescent properties of quartz crystals, which change with age. today, anew paperis out with the results, and the scientists say both sets of evidence align with the dates of their original findings. jeff pigati, also from the u.s. geological survey, hopes this will close the case. ""people can argue against any single dating technique,"" he said. ""but it's the totality of the study, the congruence of the ages from all three different dating techniques, that really make our results exceptionally robust."" some skepticism lingers. loren davis, a professor of anthropology at oregon state university who co-authored the critical paper last year, said he thinks the new research is important, but not conclusive. ""i unfortunately don't share their conclusions that they have resolved the issue of timing of when people were making these footprints,"" he said. he said the samples of quartz came from the lowest deposit of the study area, and that the possible age range is broad. he also said that the sample was less useful because it was taken from a clay layer, that does not have footprints embedded in it. stringer and pigati disputed his interpretation. they said that in fact the samples that they took came from between the first and second layers of footprints that they studied, and that the clay layer is intermingled with the layers of sediments in which footprints are embedded. with findings with such broad implications, the debate is sure to continue. but in recent years, other sites that might be older than about 14,000 years have started to get more attention.researchers from vanderbilt universitybelieve the monte verde site in southern chile was established more than 15,000 years ago.archaeologists in texashave also dated human-made artifacts to as much as 15,500 years ago. ""things are changing extremely rapidly,"" said edward jolie, a professor of anthropology at the university of arizona who worked on the footprints project. ""what's exciting about the white sands discoveries is that they really forced us to entertain this notion that significant parts of what we thought we knew or understood are in need of some revision,"" he said. jolie, who is of oglala lakota and hodulgee muscogee heritage, says technology is transforming his field. but there's something else, too: more indigenous people are involved in research into these early americans. ""given that the vast majority of archaeology in the americas is the archaeology of native americans, it's particularly significant that native voices, indigenous voices have become more prominent and more accepted,"" he said. he said those new voices are asking different questions, and moving toward new answers.",Neutral

under pressure from both parties to show decisive action at the border. in short, biden officials claim that even though he may not want to build a wall, he must, or he will face serious political consequences. but new fences are not a reversal of the democratic party’s agenda. they are part of an extensive history of both democrats and republicans selling americans on the idea that they can stop border-crossings by simply starting a new program or building a big fence. politicians from both parties have consistently attempted to “close the border,” as if doing so is actually possible, let alone desirable. biden is not continuing construction on trump’s border wall; he is continuing to build america’s border wall. read more:in reversal, biden moves to expand border wall the first border fences built along the u.s.-mexico border to curb immigration from mexico began in earnest under democrats franklin delano roosevelt and harry s. truman. afterbuilding fences for decades to stop animals, the federal government shifted its focus when people began migrating in significant numbers from south to north in the 1940s and 1950s. in this transitional moment, both mexico and the united states embraced the border’s permeability. to fill labor gaps left by world war ii, the nations agreed to a guest worker program, known as thebraceroprogram. not everyone qualified to participate, though, so thousands began migrating independently. growers in the north yearned for affordable labor. mexicans within and outside of the program provided it. under pressure to control the flow of people, the roosevelt administration began planning fence construction in urban areas to divert traffic to more isolated areas. by the end of the truman administration, most border cities were fenced. even as both nations facilitated mexican migration, they looked to fences to aid them in filtering who could enter. the bracero program ended in 1964, and a year later, democrat lyndon b. johnson signed the immigration and nationality act which, for the first time, placed a cap on the number of people who could immigrate to the u.s. from western hemisphere countries like mexico. this shift in regulation directed greater attention to the border. read more:what donald trump got right—and wrong—about the history of deportation despite new laws and fences, immigrants kept coming. lured by u.s. demand, smugglers brought drugs, too. in 1969, republican richard nixon launched operation intercept. he tried to close the border for weeks to stop the movement of illicit drugs. the initiative increased security and surveillance—a virtual fence, not a material one—but it failed by its own measure. two years later, first lady pat nixon established friendship park along the border near san diego where people could celebrate cross-border culture. at the dedication ceremony, nixon requested that her security detail cut strands of barbed wire there so that she could greet mexicans across the borderline. “i hope there won’t be a fence too long here,” the republican famously said. nixon’s administration never built significant barriers. facing economic distress and american angst with rising tides of labor migrations from mexico, democrat jimmy carter replaced the fence nixon had cut with a bigger, stronger fence in 1979. a year before it went up, its design stirred controversy when the contractor stated it would “sever the toes” of anyone who dared to breach it. after public outcry, carter’s administration redesigned the fence to be plain, but tightly woven, wire mesh topped with barbed wire. even if that fence did not sever toes, it did tear through pat nixon’s bi-nationally spirited park. republican ronald reagan also closed the border for a few weeks in 1985, repeating operation intercept. despite his idea that he could close the border at his whim, reagan, like first lady nixon, demonstrated hesitation about actual border fences. in a1980 debatewith future president george h.w. bush, reagan had said, “rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems, make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while they’re working and earning here they pay taxes here.” reagan later signed the 1986 immigration reform and control act. the law provided legalization to over two million undocumented immigrants who had been working in the united states, increased the legal culpability for employers who hired undocumented people, and provided funding for more border patrol agents. although reagan did not build fences, his administration did maintain the ones that existed, and he provided funds to increase border surveillance, as did george h.w. bush. in the 1990s intense xenophobia and public debate about unauthorized immigration escalated in the united states,prompting both parties to move toward physically securing the border.democrat bill clinton’s policies would not just tear through pat nixon’s park, they would effectively destroy it. in 1993 and 1994, clinton launched three separate border operations: operation hold the line in texas, operation safeguard in arizona, and operation gatekeeper in southern california. read more:barriers to a border wall the fences were part of what clinton referred to as a“get tough policy at our borders.”he used steel surplus military landing mats, which the army corps of engineers welded together, to build an allegedly impassable wall. in the middle of friendship park, the immigration and naturalization service built three parallel fences. multiple fences, they argued, would allow agents to catch fence-jumpers in between them. clinton’s barriers to humans went up alongside nafta, which opened the border to material goods, once again making the border more of a sieve than a seal. instead of stopping people from crossing, a more militarized border diverted them to dangerous landscapes, increasing migrant deaths exponentially. in the decade following clinton’s fences,deaths along the border doubled. like his father, george w. bush began his presidency hoping to build bridges with mexico. he floated the idea of reviving and expanding a bracero-style guest worker program to allow mexicans to work in the united states legally. he made that recommendation consistently,even after the terrorist attacks of 2001. but reacting to those same attacks also led bush and congress to tighten border security and ultimately abandon his plan. in 2006, bush signed the secure fence act, authorizing 700 miles of double-layered, reinforced fencing. when he left office, he had completed more than 500 miles. barack obama continued the work, building 130 more miles of fencing. he also famously funded the border patrol and deported more people than any president before him. read more:trump's immigration crackdown seems designed to spread fear although donald trump championed building his wall, his administration only built about 85 miles of new fences. biden will now add 20 more. additional fencing will do what previous fencing has done: impose severe harm—on the environment, on borderland communities, livestock, and most of all on the human beings hoping to cross who will be diverted into costlier and deadlier routes. fences have transformed the borderlands into a racialized graveyard, but they have not and will not stop people from migrating if doing so is a matter of survival. in a future where climate crises and political unrest is certain, so too are continued waves of migration. fences cannot “close the border” because borders are never simply open or shut. and the costs of making them impenetrable are grave. as it stands, fences are piecemeal and violent. and historically, republicans have been less inclined to build them than democrats. there are currently 700 miles of non-contiguous fences along the 1,951-mile border. a republican built most of those, but we cannot ignore that democrats have also built and supported their fair share, showing bipartisan commitment to this symbol of illusory control. biden has not made an about-face, he is simply continuing an interminable trend of border-building policies and now, like many who came before him, he has fallen into the same, familiar, repetitive pattern.

State and local Democratic leaders who should be among his close… [+6517 chars]",Mexico,"the recent surge of migrants crossing the us-mexico border has put president joe biden in a difficult, politically threatening bind.  state and local democratic leaders who should be among his closest allies heading into next year's presidential election are harshly criticising his handling of immigration. his probable 2024 republican opponent, donald trump, is sharpening his attacks on an issue that has been a central part of his political message for almost a decade. and public support for mr biden on the situation is souring. while voting is still more than a year away, the growing immigration crisis - whose effects are being felt thousands of miles from the us-mexico border in part because republican governors have been sending newly arrived migrants to democratic-run cities - could be a daunting political drag on mr biden's popularity and his re-election hopes. the numbers paint a darkening picture. according to preliminary us department of homeland security figures obtained by bbc partner cbs news, us border patrol apprehended approximately 210,000 undocumented migrants entering the us during the month of september. that is the highest mark of the year, and comes close to matching the record peak monthly apprehensions of late 2022.  if the biden administration thought the crisis at the border was easing and the national spotlight was moving to other issues after government policy changes earlier this year, the latest increase should dispel that notion. what's more, the nature of the immigrant surge suggests there may be no end in sight. roughly a quarter of the border apprehensions last month were citizens of venezuela, the south american nation that has been struggling through political and economic hardship under the socialist dictatorship of nicolas maduro.  the venezuelan exodus has created a hemispheric refugee crisis, with more than seven million fleeing the country - and the consequences are being increasingly felt on us soil. more than 150,000 venezuelans have headed north toward the us, across the darian gap into central america, in the past two months, according to the government of panama. ""people don't pick up and leave their homes just for the heck of it,"" janet napolitano, head of homeland security during the obama administration, told the bbc. ""they're usually in desperate straits - poverty, joblessness, high crime, violence, lack of civil institutions in their countries of origin."" on thursday, the biden administration announced two new steps to address the dramatic increase - and both have opened the president up to attacks from across the political spectrum. the president issued a series of environmental and planning waivers and released funds to build additional sections of wall along the us-mexico border.  he also revealed that the us would resume direct deportations of venezuelan citizens - a practice that had been suspended because of tense diplomatic relations between the two nations. these new measures were quickly denounced as too little by immigration hard-liners and too much by left-wing immigration activists. the president's muddled explanations - that he still believes walls don't work and that it was money he was forced by congress to spend - compounded the situation. the venezuelan announcement also represents a change in attitude by the administration, after moves last month to allow approximately half a million venezuelan refugees in the us to apply for work permits and avoid deportation for 18 months.  in trying to assuage concerns that he is not doing enough to address the border surge while also keeping his liberal supporters happy, he appears to be satisfying no one - a conundrum that has played itself out repeatedly on border policy throughout the biden presidency. immigration has become an intensely polarising issue, due in no small part to mr trump's ""build the wall"" rhetoric and sometimes draconian policies during his presidency. that has greatly curtailed mr biden's political flexibility in dealing with the crises.  where barack obama was able to increase deportations and strengthen border security during his presidency without facing damaging blowback from liberal activists, mr biden has no such luxury. every step he takes on immigration is now viewed in the context of the current environment of partisan political trench warfare, with mr trump and the republicans on one side and the democrats on the other. meanwhile, recent polling suggests that in that partisan fight, the public is turning on the president. respondents in a new marquette university poll of registered voters were asked to choose who was ""better"" on the issue of immigration and border security, the current president or the man he replaced. fifty-two percent said they preferred mr trump, while only 28% opted for mr biden. that is tied with the economy for the largest issue gap between the two candidates and stands in contrast to topics like abortion and climate change, where mr biden has solid leads. those results were mirrored in an nbc news poll, which found 45% of americans thought republicans were better at dealing with immigration versus only 27% for democrats. it represents a marked change from the trump presidency, when pluralities of the us public preferred the democrats. the steady drumbeat of disturbing news from the border, as well as the strain on public services felt by the major us cities where the migrants are settling, is making a noticeable mark on public opinion.  and if the crisis does not ease before the 2024 general election campaign begins in earnest, the president will be taking on his republican opponent on unfavourable political terrain. according to ms napolitano, solving the immigration crisis will take a concerted effort from the biden team. ""it requires diplomatic outreach,"" she says. ""it requires investment in other countries so that we take away some of the incentive to migrate. and it requires strong border security and effective enforcement of our immigration laws, which need to be amended and reformed."" in the end, the criticism mr biden receives for his actions on immigration this week will be much less important than whether or not the new policies work. if they don't, and if the biden administrations other steps to staunch the flow of migrants from venezuela and elsewhere are also unsuccessful, his path to re-election becomes more perilous.",Negative

isabel de la cruz, a resident of acapulco, tried to move a shopping cart loaded with diapers, instant noodles and toilet paper through the mud. she viewed what she took as a chance to help her family after she lost the tin roof of her home and her family’s important documents in the hurricane. “when is the government ever going to look after the common people?” she said. inside one store, national guard officers allowed looters to take perishable items like food, but made futile efforts to prevent people from taking appliances, even as people outside loaded refrigerators on top of taxis. it took nearly all day wednesday for authorities to partially reopen the main highway connecting acapulco to the state capital chilpancingo andmexico city. the vital ground link allowed dozens of emergency vehicles, personnel and trucks carrying supplies to reach the battered port. acapulco’s commercial and military airports were still too badly damaged to resume flights. acapulco's diamond zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that foro tv posted online wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. people wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. wednesday night the city plunged into darkness. there was no phone service, but some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the red cross to let family members know they were ok. read more:how el niño may test the limits of our climate knowledge alicia galindo, a 28-year-old stylist in the central mexican city of san luis potosi, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. her parents and brother were staying in acapulco’s hotel princess for an international mining conference when otis hit early wednesday with 165 mph (270 kmh) winds. they told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when ""windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down ... until everything was gone,” she said in a telephone interview with the associated press. fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. however, galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. on tuesday, otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful category 5 as it tore along the coast. “it’s one thing to have a category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you’re expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you’re not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,” said brian mcnoldy, ahurricaneresearcher at the university of miami. acapulco is at the foot of steep mountains. luxury homes and slums alike cover the hillsides with views of the glistening pacific ocean. once drawing hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, the port has in recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the caribbean waters of cancun and the riviera maya or beaches farther down the pacific coast in the state of oaxaca. lópez obrador noted that otis was a stronger hurricane than pauline, which hit acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people. ___ verza reported from mexico city. associated press science writer seth borenstein in washington contributed to this report.",Negative

""texas installed razor wire in eagle pass to stop illegal crossings. today the biden admin cut that wire, opening the floodgates to illegal immigrants. i immediately deployed more texas national guard to repel illegal crossings& install more razor wire,"" he posted on x. but the lawsuit filed last week goes farther in its accusation of wrongdoing, claiming federal agents are destroying the wire to ""encourage and assist thousands of aliens to illegally cross the rio grande."" the lawsuit is also likely to affect the relationship between cbp and texas state authorities that gov. abbott has attempted to authorize to enforce federal immigration law, like texas dps and the texas national guard. it also comes as texan lawmakers are close to approving house bill 4, which would authorize local and state law enforcement officials to arrest migrants and return them ""to the foreign nation from which the person entered or attempted to enter.""  ""this is just another example of texas refusing to accept the fact that it's the responsibility of the federal government to enforce the immigration laws and secure the border, not the responsibility of the state,"" said tom jawetz, a senior fellow at center for american progress and former deputy general counsel for dhs. the lawsuit raises several legal questions about whether texas can prevent federal agents from enforcing immigration and asylum laws. in areas like eagle pass, texas, the concertina wire is placed on the northern and u.s. side of the rio grande river, which means migrants who reach it are already on u.s. soil and legally allowed to enter through for apprehension and processing. ""you find actually, a lot of the actual wall structures in texas are well within u.s. territory. even for the portion from the international boundary line, up to that wall, anyone standing in that area has equal rights under the law to seek asylum as someone standing north of whatever boundary line,"" said elissa steglich, a clinical professor and co-director of the immigration clinic at the university of texas school of law. the department of homeland security declined to comment on the lawsuit, but added that it would abide by the court’s order. ""we do not comment on pending litigation. generally speaking, border patrol agents have a responsibility under federal law to take those who have crossed onto u.s. soil without authorization into custody for processing, as well as to act when there are conditions that put our workforce or migrants at risk. we will, of course, comply with the order issued by the court this morning,” a dhs spokesperson said. during an interview with abc news correspondent matt rivers in september, usbp chief jason owens alluded to the fact that agents can’t simply prevent people from entering the u.s. ""so i think there's a lot of misunderstanding about what border patrol agents can and can't do. we see a lot of a lot of folks say just push people back, just don't let them cross or send them back immediately. the u.s. border patrol is a law enforcement agency, we enforce the laws that are on the books, we don't have the right, nor should we, to deny somebody due process once they are on american soil…you don't want a law enforcement agency that goes rogue and doesn't adhere to those principles,"" he said.",Neutral

""it was kind of a big deal and earth-shattering and rocked the world of the archaeologists,""  kathleen springer, a scientist with the us geological survey, toldthe washington post. some scientists, however, were skeptical, both about the age of the prints and the method used to date them. now some of the original researchers say they've done more tests to verify the age. in the2021 paper, scientists from the national parks service, us geological survey, and other institutions dated seeds from an aquatic ditchgrass, found between sediment layers containing the footprints. they used a classic technique called radiocarbon dating which involves measuring the amount of carbon remaining after a dead organism based on the rate at which carbon isotopes decay. some scientists who were skeptical of the footprints' agepointed outthat the seeds may contain more ancient carbon sources than the contemporary atmosphere. aquatic plants may absorb carbon from groundwater that didn't come in contact with the atmosphere for long periods of time, and thus radiocarbon dating makes them appear older than they really were. or, the seeds may have made their way into the footprints from another site where they were preserved thousands of years earlier. for the most recent paper, published this month in the journalscience, springer, jeff pigati, and other co-authors set out to settle the debate. they radiocarbon dated pollen grains from conifer plants in the area. in addition, they used another technique, optically stimulated luminescence (osl), to date the sediment. with osl, the researchers looked at grains, such as quartz, to see when they were last exposed to light. both the recent radiocarbon dating and the osl were consistent with the footprints being between 21,000 and 23,000 years old. taken together, the data from the latest study ""strongly indicate human presence in the americas"" around 20,000 years ago, archaeologist bente philippsen who wasn't involved with the latest study,wrotein an article in science accompanying the paper. but loren davis, a professor of anthropology at oregon state university, would like to see more evidence before accepting the footprints' age.

crimes by cutting off essential supplies including food, water and fuel. read more:for gazans, there are no safe havens bipartisan support for israel has already eroded in recent years as progressive democrats have become more outspoken in their opposition to the country’s decades-long occupation of palestinian territory, which is widely viewed as illegal by the international community. there are rumbles of disagreement within biden's administration as well. josh paul, a state department official who oversaw the congressional liaison office dealing with foreign arms sales,resigned over u.s. policy on weapons transfers to israel. “i cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that i believe to be short-sighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse,” he wrote in a statement posted to his linkedin account. a speech from the oval office is one of the most prestigious platforms that a president can command, an opportunity to try to seize the country’s attention at a moment of crisis. the major television networks broke into regular programming to carry the address live. biden has delivered only one other such speech during his presidency, after congress passed bipartisan budget legislation to avert a default on the country’s debt. the white house and other senior administration officials, including office of management and budget director shalanda young, have quietly briefed key lawmakers in recent days about the contours of the planned supplemental funding request. the democratic senate plans to move quickly on biden’s proposal, hoping that it creates pressure on the republican-controlled house to resolve its leadership drama and return to legislating. read more:house republicans show where israel ranks (right behind their infighting) however, there are disagreements within the senate, too, on how to move forward. eight republicans, led by kansas sen. roger marshall, said they did not want to combine assistance for ukraine and israel in the same legislation. “these are two separate and unrelated conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to israel in an attempt to get additional aid for ukraine across the finish line,” they wrote in a letter. north dakota sen. kevin cramer said he was fine with the proposal as long as there was also a fresh effort to address border issues. but he said “it’s got to be designed to secure the border, not to facilitate travel through the border.” although there was a lull in migrant arrivals to the u.s. after the start of new asylum restrictions in may, illegal crossings topped a daily average of more than 8,000 last month. sen. chris murphy, a connecticut democrat who leads a senate panel that oversees funding for the department of homeland security, was wary of any effort to overhaul border policy during a debate over spending. “how are we going to settle our differences over immigration in the next two weeks?” murphy said. “this is a supplemental funding bill. the minute you start loading it up with policies, that sounds like a plan to fail.” biden’s decision to include funding for the indo-pacific in his proposal is a nod toward the potential for another international conflict.china wants to reunify the self-governing island of taiwan with its mainland, a goal that could be carried out through force. although wars in europe and the middle east have been the most immediate concerns for u.s. foreign policy, biden views asia as the key arena in the struggle for global influence. the administration’s national security strategy, released last year, describes china as “america’s most consequential geopolitical challenge.” —associated press

""you have been warned. respectfully, los chapitos."" mexican authorities have not confirmed the authenticity of the banners and abc news was unable to verify that they were in fact issued by los chapitos. but sources in the region said the banners are legitimate.  if the banners are real, it does not mean the sinaloa cartel's chapitos network will suddenly cease its fentanyl operations and shipments. that portion of the business brings in incredible amounts of cash and there are many thousands of people involved in the trade across multiple countries, so a fentanyl ban would be complex and take time to unwind. even if the cartel were to stop its production and sale of fentanyl in sinaloa, those operations could continue in many other mexican states where the cartel has a presence. fentanyl has become a top priority in the bilateral security relationship between mexico and the united states, after the powerful synthetic opioid caused tens of thousands ofoverdose deathsamong americans this year alone.  the u.s. drug enforcement administration is offering $10 million rewards for information leading tothe arrest and/or convictionof two of el chapo's fugitive sons, who have also been added to the agency's 10 most-wanted list. the sinaloa cartel leadership, including el chapo's sons, are keenly aware of the optics and political pressure surrounding fentanyl, according to sources in the region familiar with the cartel’s thinking. the heat that the u.s. is putting on mexico to address the issue, in turn, gets passed on to the cartel in the way of raids and arrests, which is not good for business. while fentanyl is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration to treat severe pain, it is the leading driver of drug overdose deaths in the country. out of an estimated 109,680 overdose deaths that occurred nationwide last year, about 75,000 werelinked to fentanyland other synthetic opioids, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. only time will tell what effect -- if any -- the banners will have in both mexico and the u.s.",Neutral

""girlfriend"" (the track) is a neat summation of the entire project. sweet slashes through the guitar chords while maher provides solid, unfussy percussion, and quine adds his unique, fauvist guitar approach. the vocals and guitars are mixed loudly, and harmony vocals add detail to a robust and insistent tune. it even gave him a top 5 single on the billboard modern rock tracks chart.finally, sweet had found his voice. aurally, girlfriend is as dry as a bone. reverb is off-limits, and the mixing is straight out of the ""beatles in stereo"" book. instruments and voices are hard-panned to the left or right, resulting in the listener being placed in the center of the performances. the studio credo was ""first take = best take"", which added to the songs' raw feel.  both sweet and quine were working through their demons during the sessions; specifically, sweet was coping with the breakdown of his marriage and the pressure on him to remain a working musician, whereas quine was dealing with numerous mental health issues. both musicians channeled their angst into the recordings, ensuring that sweet's perfectly conceived pop compositions had a harsh, jagged edge. yin and yang. the tracks are as varied as a truck stop jukebox, but they all hang together beautifully. for instance, ""girlfriend"", ""holy war"", and ""does she talk?"" are tight and aggressive rockers. on the other hand, ""nothing lasts"" and ""winona"" are plaintive ballads, just as ""i wanted to tell you"" and ""i've been waiting"" are definitive examples of power-pop. sweet combines all the elements of that often-derided genre in the latter piece, creating something that can hold its head high next to ""september gurls"" and ""i feel fine"". from sweet's ringing arpeggios to richard lloyd's short but stinging solo (via a vocal melody that's so perfect and timeless), it'll have you fruitlessly working through your record collection looking for its antecedents. it's become the benchmark for guitar pop. you should take some time today and listen to the whole album. and also enjoy thisgreat short set—which includes two of the best songs from the album, ""girlfriend"" and ""i've been waiting""—from april, 1992. just skip ahead 40 seconds so you don't have to see or hear dennis miller.",Positive

<li>Echazarre… [+6412 chars]",Mexico,"this is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with katya echazarreta, a 28-year-old mexican electrical engineer and citizen astronaut. she became the first mexican-born woman to go to space in 2022. the essay has been edited for length and clarity. i was born in guadalajara, mexico. my childhood there was a bit difficult, not necessarily because we were in mexico, but rather because of my sister's situation. my older sister has mental and physical disabilities, and she got meningitis when she was very small, leaving her with epilepsy, paralysis down half her body, and the mental state of about an 8-year-old child. this happened in the '90s, and the medical care necessary to take care of somebody like my sister wasn't available in mexico. so my parents made the decision to immigrate to california when i was 7 years old. the transition was difficult for me, mostly because i didn't speak english. i've always been the kind of kid that found comfort and a happy place in school. but in the classroom in the us, i would sit for hours and hours, but everything was nonsense to me because i didn't understand english. i started to fall behind, and was also made fun of. knowing you're bullied but not knowing what it's about because you don't understand what they're saying — it just feeds into it more. learning english became my number-one priority. if i was going to learn about space and science — which i'd always been curious and passionate about — i knew i needed to master the language. everything in my life needed to be in english, from the books and articles i read, to the tv shows and movies i watched. i only spoke spanish to my mom, who still hadn't learned english at that point. i learned how to communicate basic language by the time i was in the fourth grade, which was a year later. by the fifth grade, i was already reading, writing, and speaking at a fifth-grader's level. and then, by the time i made it to the sixth grade, i was reading, writing, and speaking at an eighth-grade level. i had a binder in early elementary school, where i had a section for the different planets in our solar system. we hooked up my first computer i'd gotten for christmas to the family printer, and, anytime i learned anything new about the planets, i'd print it out and add it to my binder. for example, i had a section on mars, and if i learned anything new about its composition, temperature, or how long its days are, i'd add those little bits of information, so i had my own little scientific journal of everything i was learning. after that, my interest and education in space became more formalized. i signed myself up for online astronomy classes when i was in elementary school using my mom's name. i did my homework and took the tests — nobody probably knew it was a 12-year-old child. i went to ucla for college and majored in electrical engineering, and i landed my dream job at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory as an intern before i was hired full time. working at nasa was surreal. the jet propulsion lab is in charge of all the robotics-led missions, likecuriosity,galileo, andjuno— these missions that havetaught us so much about our solar system. i have these moments where i snap back into the reality of my job and realize that my normal workday and paperwork is what's helping themars rover take its first test drive. in 2019, i heard about space for humanity, a non-profit program that sent citizen astronauts into space. i applied almost immediately. i didn't hear back until three years later, but during that time, i completed a space training program where i did training with microgravity, g-force, and pressurized spacesuits. when i heardi was selectedout of 7,000 applicants from over 120 countries, i had to jump on psychological training, because my mission was to analyze the effects on a human being when you're able to look at the planet from the outside. that training proved to be crucial for when i finally went up to space on theblue origin ns-21 missionin june 2022. i wanted to be excited, of course, but not to the point where i was stressed or anxious. i learned how to visualize myself in the capsule whenever i felt relaxed to associate myself being in the capsule with being calm. and it worked. it's such an incredible thing to understand as you're going up to space that not only is it you doing this and seeing the sights, but you're also considered the first, and one of the very few people that have done it. and thateven fewer of those are women. when you consider how fewer than 800 people have ever been able to see what you're seeing right now — it's a mix of so many different thoughts, feelings, and also a massive understanding of the privilege you have in the moment. i'd always known that a mexican-born woman hadn't traveled into space before because i'd been obsessed with this topic for so long. i knew aboutjosé hernández, i knew aboutellen ochoa, i knew aboutrodolfo neri vela, the first mexican-born individual to travel to space nearly 40 years ago. and i knew that all of this had happened a very long time ago. so when i was selected for this, i understood that it wasn't something that just meant a lot to me, but rather that this was going to be something that is very major for an entire community. i understood i had a big load to carry, and that i had to manage the newfound attention with respect. i've since startedfundación espacial, a foundation that provides opportunities for people in our communities to explore the space industry. it's become part of my job to not only continue to help others feel inspired, but also to open up more doors so that they can potentially achieve something like this, so that it doesn't take another 40 years.",Neutral

him at a transit station. deng guangsen, 28, had spent the last two months traveling to san diego from the southern chinese province of guangdong, through seven countries on plane, bus and foot, including traversing panama’s dangerous darién gap jungle. “i feel nothing,” deng said in the san diego parking lot, insisting on using the broken english he learned from the “harry potter” film series. “i have no brother, no sister. i have nobody.” deng is part of a major influx of chinese migration to the united states on a relatively new and perilous route that has become increasingly popular with the help of social media. chinese people were the fourth-highest nationality, after venezuelans, ecuadorians, and haitians, crossing the darién gap during the first nine months of this year, according to panamanian immigration authorities. chinese asylum-seekers who spoke to the associated press, as well as observers, say they are seeking to escape an increasingly repressive political climate and bleak economic prospects. they also reflect a broader presence of migrants at the u.s.-mexico border — asians, south americans, and africans — who made september the second-highest month of illegal crossings and the u.s. government’s 2023 budget year the second-highest on record. the pandemic and china’s covid-19 policies, which included tight border controls, temporarily stemmed the exodus that rose dramatically in 2018 when president xi jinping amended the constitution to scrap the presidential term limit. now emigration has resumed, withchina’s economy

chinese character whose pronunciation spells like the english word “run” but means “moistening.” now it’s an internet meme. “this wave of emigration reflects despair toward china,” cai xia, editor-in-chief of the online commentary site of yibao and a former professor at the central party school of the chinese communist party in beijing. “they’ve lost hope for the future of the country,” said cai, who now lives in the u.s. “you see among them the educated and the uneducated, white-collar workers, as well as small business owners, and those from well-off families.” those who can’t get a visa are finding other ways to flee the world’s most populous nation. many are showing up at the u.s.-mexico border to seek asylum. the border patrol made 22,187 arrests of chinese for crossing the border illegally from mexico from january through september, nearly 13 times the same period in 2022. arrests peaked at 4,010 in september, up 70% from august. the vast majority were single adults. the popular route to the u.s. is through ecuador, which has no visa requirements for chinese nationals. migrants from china join latin americans there to trek north through the once-impenetrable darién and across several central american countries before reaching the u.s. border. the journey is well-known enough it has its own name in chinese: walk the line, or “zouxian.” read more:how panama became the most treacherous crossing point for migrants on a long journey to the u.s. the monthly number of chinese migrants crossing the darién has been rising gradually, from 913 in january to 2,588 in september. for the first nine months of this year, panamanian immigration authorities registered 15,567 chinese citizens crossing the darién. by comparison, 2,005 chinese people trekked through the rainforest in 2022, and just 376 in total from 2010 to 2021. short video platforms and messaging apps provide not only on-the-ground video clips but also step-by-step guides from china to the u.s., including tips on what to pack, where to find guides, how to survive the jungle, which hotels to stay at, how much to bribe police in different countries and what to do when encountering u.s. immigration officers. translation apps allow migrants to navigate through central america on their own, even if they don’t speak spanish or english. the journey can cost thousands to tens of thousands of dollars, paid for with family savings or even online loans. it’s markedly different from the days when chinese nationals paid smugglers, known as snakeheads, and traveled in groups. with more financial resources, xi yan, 46, and her daughter song siming, 24, didn’t trek the ecuador-mexico route, but instead flew into mexico via europe. with help from a local guide, the two women crossed the border at mexicali into the u.s. in april. “the unemployment rate is very high. people cannot find work,” said xi yan, a chinese writer. “for small business owners, they cannot sustain their businesses.” read more:china’s solution to inequality? cracking down on displays of wealth and poverty xi yan said she decided to leave china in march, when she traveled to the southern city of foshan to see her mother but had to leave the next day when state security agents and police officers harassed her brother and told him that his sister was not allowed in the city. she realized she was still on the state blacklist, six years after being detained for gathering at a seaside spot to remember liu xiaobo, a nobel peace laureate who died in a chinese prison. in 2015, she was locked up for 25 days over an online post remembering the victims of the 1989 tiananmen massacre. her daughter, song, agreed to leave with her. a college graduate, the daughter struggled to find work in china and became depressed, the mother said. despite the challenges to survive in the u.s., xi yan said it was worth it. “we have freedom,” she said. “i used to get nervous whenever there was a police car. now, i don’t have to worry about it anymore.” migrants hoping to enter the u.s. at san diego wait for agents to pick them up in an area between two border walls or in remote mountains east of the city covered with shrubs and large boulders. many migrants are released with court dates in cities nearest their final destination in a bottlenecked system that takes years to decide cases. chinese migrants had an asylum grant rate of 33% in the 2022 budget year, compared with 46% for all nationalities, according to syracuse university’stransactional records access clearinghouse. read more:tens

going to new york, they’re going to chicago, they’re going to all kinds of places,” said vino pajanor, the group’s chief executive. “they don’t want to be in a shelter.” in september, 98% of u.s. border arrests of chinese people occurred in the san diego area. at the transit stop, migrants charge phones, snack, browse piles of free clothing, and get travel advice. signs at portable bathrooms and information booths and a volunteer’s loudspeaker announcements about free airport shuttles are translated to multiple languages, including mandarin. taxi drivers offer rides to los angeles. many migrants who spoke to the ap did not give their full names out of fear of drawing attention to their cases. some said they came for economic reasons and paid 300,000 to 400,000 yuan ($41,000 to $56,000 for the trip). in recent weeks, chinese migrants have filled makeshift encampments in the california desert as they wait to turn themselves in to u.s. authorities to make asylum claims. read

volunteers who distribute bottled water, hot oatmeal, and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. chen yixiao said he endured a hard journey to come to the u.s. he said life had become difficult back home, with some migrants experiencing issues with the government and others failing in business. “i’m very happy to be in the u.s. now. this is my dream country,” said chen, who planned to join his

provide the border patrol with a u.s. address, an agent scheduled an initial immigration court appearance for him in new york in february. deng said he worked a job in guangdong requiring him to ride

""if i buy asthma medicine,"" ángel explains, ""then we won't be able to eat."" the marín family is joining the7.7 millionmigrants who have left venezuela in recent years to escape authoritarian rule and the country's worst economic crisis. that's about one-quarter of the population venezuela had when the crisis began around 2014. it tops the number of refugees who have fled either war-ravagedukraineorsyriaand amounts to the largest displacementcrisisever recorded in the western hemisphere. most have resettled incolombia, peru and elsewhere in latin america, but a growing number of venezuelans — including ángel, carolina and matías — are on their way to the united states. for the first time, venezuelans in septemberbecame the largest nationalityarrested for illegally crossing the southern u.s. border, outnumbering mexicans, according tofigures releasedby u.s. customs and border protection. venezuelans were arrested 54,833 times by the border patrol that month, more than double the figure for august. analysts blame venezuela's economic collapse on government corruption, mismanagement of the vital oil industry andu.s. sanctionsagainst president nicolás maduro's authoritarian regime. at the low point in 2021 during the covid-19 pandemic, the poverty rate topped 90%, according toresearchers atandrés bello catholic university in caracas. migrants gather at a crossing into el paso, texas, as seen from ciudad juárez, mexico, dec. 20, 2022.christian chavez/aphide caption migrants gather at a crossing into el paso, texas, as seen from ciudad juárez, mexico, dec. 20, 2022. the decline of the marín family's circumstances was gradual but relentless, and tracked with their country's economic collapse. ángel, 29, and carolina, 31, attended the university of zulia, a once highly regarded public institution in the lakeside city of maracaibo. ángel studied philosophy and dreamed of getting his diploma, noting that south american liberator simón bolívar once declared: ""a person without education is an incomplete person."" but professors quit over low pay, classes were often canceled due to anti-government protests and electricity blackouts, and the couple dropped out when they could no longer afford tuition. carolina focused on raising matías while ángel worked at banks and a refrigeration company and sold cellphones, never earning more than $150 a month. that's above average — and venezuela's minimum wage is just $4 a month, not enough to get by on. unable to afford their own place, they moved in with carolina's parents and brother. food was scarce and they sometimes ate just two meals per day. one trick was to sleep late to avoid the urge for breakfast. another was to make a stew from the skins of ripe plantains. carolina insisted they tasted like meat. ""at least it fills you up,"" she says. with limited prospects in venezuela and matías' asthma getting worse, they decided to follow the path of carolina's younger sister, who migrated to st. louis five years ago, found a job cleaning offices, and has offered to take them in. ángel jokes that he'll have to improve his almost nonexistent english. but carolina's mother, elizabeth rodríguez, is in a somber mood at the prospect of her second daughter leaving venezuela for good. ""it makes me want to cry,"" she says. ""because you always imagine having your family close by and watching your grandchildren grow up."" because they lack visas, ángel, carolina and matias will travel overland through central america and mexico to get to the u.s. the trip will involve a tough, 60-mile hikeacross the darién gap. that's a roadless patch of jungle between colombia and panama, where many migrants have been robbed, raped and killed. ""we really don't want to go through the jungle,"" ángel admits. ""it scares us."" the trip will cost thousands of dollars, some of which they have borrowed from friends and relatives in the u.s. every little bit helps, which is why, besides unloading their tv and ac, they're selling matias' baby clothes. carolina wanted to save them for a second child. but with their future so uncertain, a larger family now seems out of the question, and carolina tears up as she folds the tiny bodysuits and pajamas. ángel and carolina marín shop for backpacks of their son.john otis for nprhide caption ángel and carolina marín shop for backpacks of their son.

""today, we recognize our ancestors and predecessors who really laid the foundation for us to stand,"" said thorne lapointe, an organizer, who is sicangu lakota. ""and we will always recognize our elders who are here and those who have gone on before us, who really kicked open the doors in their time, nationally and internationally."" seventeen states and washington, d.c., have holidays honoring indigenous people, according to the pew research center. many of them celebrate it on the second monday of october, pivoting from a day long rooted in the celebration of explorer christopher columbus to one focused on the people whose lives and culture were forever changed by colonialism. dozens of cities and school systems also now observe indigenous peoples day. ""i think it just look a long time because we are indigenous people — we always have to fight for recognition as we have been since the first ships arrived,"" matafahi said in an interview at the gathering in phoenix. in augusta, maine, several hundred people celebrated indigenous peoples day by rallying outside the state house in support of a nov. 7 statewide vote that would restore language about the state's obligations to native american tribes to printed versions of its constitution. maulian bryant, penobscot nation ambassador and president of the wabanaki alliance, said once people understand the importance to native americans, they will support it like they did when towns, and then the state, enacted indigenous peoples day. bryant recalled the successful grassroots conversations that took place about the legacy of columbus, whose arrival brought violence, disease and suffering to native americans. ""we want to honor the true stewards of these lands,"" she said. in south dakota, dozens of people marched to a memorial at a park honoring native american children who died at the rapid city indian school in the late 1800s before it was closed in 1933. others who gathered in anchorage, alaska, said a celebration like the one there monday would have been unheard of six decades ago. gina ondola, a dena'ina athabascan, said she graduated from east anchorage high school in 1962 with only four or five other alaska natives in her class and certainly no indigenous culture club. ""we didn't learn much about our history,"" she said. instead they were taught how white europeans who came to north america were slaughtered by native americans. ""when i was growing up, i didn't feel too much pride in being native. i always heard about 'drunk natives,'"" said odola, who was wearing black gloves with red and white beadwork to represent her family's colors. ""it feels good for me to be able to feel pride in who i am,"" she said. the anchorage celebration included alaska native dance groups, traditional alaska native game demonstrations and a student wearing a ""molly of denali"" costume. the pbs show was the nation's first children's series to feature indigenous leads. abigael hollis, a freshman film student at the institute of american indian arts, was among those who attended a powwow at a downtown plaza in santa fe, new mexico. it brought together native american dancing groups from throughout the state and beyond, as well as native american jewelers, potters and weavers who sold artwork at outdoor stands. ""it's celebrating the fact that my ancestors lived to have me, and that we're still around and that we can celebrate each other and love each other,"" said hollis, who is of cherokee ancestry and wore traditional dress, including a coming-of-age necklace made of buffalo bone and glass beads. new mexico, which is home to 23 federally recognized native american communities, replaced columbus day with indigenous peoples day through legislation in 2019. the santa fe festival began with a blessing by dancers from nearby tesuque pueblo — an acknowledgement that the city stands on the pueblo's ancestral lands, said caren gala, who heads the santa fe indigenous center and helped organize the powwow.

""while i appreciate all the time and energy our supporters have given, it is important to recognize the realities of the political landscape and the need to consolidate our party around one person to defeat both donald trump and president biden,"" hurd wrote on x, the platform formerly known as twitter. he added that haley, a former u.s. ambassador to the united nations under trump and governor of south carolina, ""has shown a willingness to articulate a different vision for the country than donald trump and has an unmatched grasp on the complexities of our foreign policy."" hurd was the last major candidate to join the already crowded republican primary field when he announced his run in late june. he leaves the race barely three months later, after failing to gain traction as pragmatic moderate who pledged to lead the party away from trump's ""make america great again"" movement. hurd failed to qualify for both the first gop debate in milwaukee in august and the second debate the following month in simi valley, california. ""america is at a crossroads and it's time to come together and make joe biden a one-term president,"" haley wrote on x in response to hurd's endorsement. ""thank you@willhurdfor your support and confidence. we have a country to save!"" hurd ending his campaign follows another republican candidate, miami mayor francis suarez, who became the first presidential hopeful to suspend his campaign shortly after failing to make the first debate stage. hurd wasn't invited to the milwaukee event after falling short of republican national committee minimums on support in the polls and sufficient numbers of donors to his campaign. hurd was initially defiant about missing the first debate, arguing that the republican party blocked him for refusing to sign a pledge for its presidential candidates to support the eventual primary winner, even if it was trump. the rnc standards are ""arbitrary, unclear, and lack consistency. this is an unacceptable process for a presidential election,"" he said in a statement. when he didn't make the second debate, hurd stuck a different tone, writing on x that ""we narrowly missed the cut for the second debate and our campaign is at an inflection point."" a clandestine cia officer who worked in pakistan, hurd served three terms in the house through january 2021 and was the chamber's only black republican during his final two years in office. he represented texas' then-most competitive district, which was heavily hispanic and stretched from the outskirts of san antonio to el paso, encompassing more than 800 miles of texas-mexico border. hurd opted not to seek reelection in 2020, saying he was pursuing opportunities outside congress ""to solve problems at the nexus between technology and national security."" last year, he traveled the country promoting his book ""american reboot: an idealist's guide to getting big things done."" the 46-year-old has long been a fierce trump antagonist, even encouraging the then-republican presidential nominee to leave the 2016 race when the""access hollywood"" tapein which trump brags about sexually assaulting women was made public in the final weeks before election day. hurd was hoping to resonate with voters seeking a pro-business republican with a strong national security background who was also unafraid to seek bipartisan consensus. he announced his candidacy criticizing both biden and trump, saying the president wasn't up to securing the u.s.-mexico border, combating fentanyl smuggling that has led to epidemic of american overdoses and violent crime and homelessness in the country's cities. ""president biden can't solve these problems — or won't,"" hurd said in his announcement video. ""and, if we nominate a lawless, selfish, failed politician like donald trump — who lost the house, the senate, and the white house — we all know joe biden will win again."" hurd stepped up his public criticism of trump as the former president was repeatedly indicted and now faces four separate criminal cases and 91 total charges. trump still holds a fundraising advantage and commanding lead in early primary polls. as a result, hurd's few memorable moments as a white house candidate came when he was heckled by republican crowds after repeating assertions that trump, should he clinch the gop nomination, would lose the general election to biden. ""donald trump is running to stay out of prison,"" hurd declared at a july gop dinner in iowa. when sustained booing followed, he responded, ""listen, i know the truth is hard.""",Neutral

— acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late wednesday — experts are calling otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the eastern pacific coast. many of the once sleek beachfront hotels looked like toothless shattered hulks, after hurricane otis blew out hundreds — and possibly thousands — of hotel windows. choked with mud and debris, with no electricity or internet service, the pacific coast resort descended into chaos after the storm, as thousands engaged in massive looting. the hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by wednesday afternoon, but left devastation in its wake. jakob sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when otis hit. “we laid down on the floor and some between beds,” sauczuk said. “we prayed a lot.” one of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. it looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mess. he complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. pablo navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. “i took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held,” said navarro. “but there were some rooms where the wind blew out the windows and the doors.” navarro said authorities seemed to have been blindsided by the hurricane's rapid intensification. he stood wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen tvs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mud-choked streets outside. “this is out of control, “ he said. acapulco's diamond zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that foro tv posted online wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. people wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. while much of the city was in the dark and without phone service, some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the red cross to let family members know they were ok. alicia galindo, a 28-year-old stylist in the central mexican city of san luis potosí, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. her parents and brother were staying in acapulco’s hotel princess for an international mining conference when otis hit. they told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when ""windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down ... until everything was gone,” she said in a telephone interview with the associated press. fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. however, galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. “everybody is trying to find something out ... but no one knows anything,"" she said anxiously. the main highway into acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. by late wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced. flor campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside acapulco on wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck. the domestic worker from a small town in guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. it was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. “we had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. it was more dangerous to stay.” campos said. on tuesday, otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful category 5 as it tore along the coast. researchers tracking the storm told the associated press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time when climate change has exacerbated devastating weather events like this one. “it’s one thing to have a category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you’re expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you’re not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,” said brian mcnoldy, a hurricane researcher at the university of miami. acapulco, tecpan and other towns along the costa grande in guerrero were hit hard, said mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador. he said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been “completely lost."" acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. luxury homes and slums alike cover the city’s hillsides with views of the glistening pacific. once drawing hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the caribbean waters of cancun and the riviera maya or beaches farther down the pacific coast in the state of oaxaca. damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, lópez obrador said. mexico’s secretary of national defense told the ap on wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that over 1,200 more were on their way. officials also said they were working to restore power and phone service. lópez obrador noted that otis was a stronger hurricane than pauline, which hit acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people. ___ follow ap’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ associated press writers maría verza in mexico city and seth borenstein in

""senate democrats will move expeditiously on this request, and we hope that our republican colleagues across the aisle will join us to pass this much-needed funding.” biden's national security adviser, jake sullivan, told reporters on friday that russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine and hamas' attack on israel represent a “global inflection point."" “this budget request is critical to advancing america’s national security and ensuring the safety of the american people,” sullivan said. the biggest line item in the supplemental funding request is $61.4 billion to support ukraine. some of that money will go to replenishing pentagon stockpiles of weapons that have already been provided. ukraine has struggled to make progress in a grueling counteroffensive, and the white house has warned that russia could gain ground if the united states does not rush more weapons and ammunition to the conflict. “the world is closely watching what congress does next,” sullivan said. israel would receive $14.3 billion in assistance under the proposal. the majority of that money would help with air and missile defense systems, according to the white house. some republicans in both the house and the senate are wary of linking funding for ukraine and israel. rep. roger williams, r-texas, said the president’s proposal was discussed in a closed-door meeting of his state’s republican delegation on friday. “you can't blend the two together,” he said, describing israel as “our friend forever.” williams said biden's proposal is “a little disturbing"" because ""he knows he can’t get it done without israel.” the reaction is emblematic of how biden's decision to roll together several different issues, in hopes of broadening the potential political coalition to ensure the legislation's passage, could also lead it to its derailment. debates over immigration will likely be the most thorny as republicans seek to bolster enforcement. some republicans have said they won’t support the measure unless new policies are added, and it is so far unclear whether the money that biden is requesting would be sufficient. a group of republican senators huddled on thursday to discuss possible proposals that they would support. shalanda young, the director of the office of management and budget, suggested it would be hypocritical for them to oppose biden's proposal after complaining about lax border management. “we will not be lectured by those who refuse to act,"" she said. ""as we’ve said repeatedly, congress needs to take action to provide sufficient resources for the border.” although there was a lull in migrant arrivals to the u.s. after the start ofnew asylum restrictions in may, illegal crossings topped a daily average of more than 8,000 last month. the white house wants roughly $14 billion to, among other things, boost the number of border agents, install new inspection machines to detect fentanyl and increase staffing to process asylum cases. sen. bill hagerty, a tennessee republican, said providing the administration with “more money to fuel its disastrous open-borders resettlement operation is insanity.” ""it would worsen the border crisis, not stop it,"" he wrote on x, formerly known as twitter. biden's funding request includes $7.4 billion for a variety of initiatives geared toward the indo-pacific, where the u.s. is focused on countering china's influence. the money is divided among joint security initiatives in the region, bolstering submarine manufacturing as part of a partnership with australia and developing financing programs for countries that would otherwise rely on beijing. another $9.15 billion is geared toward humanitarian efforts in ukraine, israel, gaza and other places. administration officials said they would determine where best to direct the money once it's approved. connecticut rep. rosa delauro, the top democrat on the house appropriations committee, said “time is of the essence” for passing the legislation. “we will be judged on how the united states responds to ongoing crises, whether we honor our commitments to our allies abroad, and how we care for innocent people around the world caught in the wake of devastation,” she said. associated press writer kevin freking contributed to this report.",Neutral

His family, from left, son Daniel Jimenez; sister Belen Lowery; Gina Macia… [+6624 chars]",Mexico,"a $37 million settlement in the bankruptcy of a prison health care company accused of responsibility in prisoner deaths is now in doubt. a federal judge has declined to consider expedited approval of the plan's disclosures, saying far too many questions remained unanswered. ""we're not going forward today,"" judge christopher lopez said at a hearing on tuesday in the southern district of texas bankruptcy court in houston. ""there's not enough time. people are entitled to the time."" the bankrupt company, tehum, formerly known as corizon health, was once the nation's leading prison health provider. as lawsuits mounted against corizon over claims of negligent care and prisoner deaths on its watch, the companypulled a controversial maneuver, the texas two-step, that involved splitting the company in two. one company, yescare, got the active prison contracts; the other, tehum, got saddled with most of corizon's debt and went into bankruptcy. the case has drawn national attention afterrevelationsthat the judge serving as mediator was in a secret romantic relationship with an attorney representing yescare. corizon's two-step has also been sharply criticized by lawmakers, including sen. elizabeth warren, who haspromised congressional oversight. attorneys representing plaintiffs in the malpractice suits against corizon said the deal would effectively allow investors to walk away with valuable assets while leaving the prisoners and their families with table scraps. at tuesday's hearing, lopez said creditors deserve more information about the parties involved in the bankruptcy and more time to review the proposed deal before it's sent out for a vote. ""there are still parties involved — and how they're connected, and what they do, and how this deal came to be, and how much money has been transferred, and whether the funding agreement was right,"" lopez said. ""there is a bunch of information that i've been asking for from the beginning of the case, well before we ever got to mediation, and those questions have yet to be answered."" lopez later added, ""i think the fundamental deal has to be reconsidered in light of what i'm saying."" jason s. brookner, an attorney for tehum, downplayed lopez's remarks, saying by email, ""he said he wasn't hearing us yesterday and we should find another date and re-set it."" many of the creditors, lopez noted, are people without timely access to mail — a clear reference to the incarcerated plaintiffs. lopez's decision comes weeks after insiderfirst raised questionsabout the fairness of the settlement, reporting that it would offer current and former prisoners a few cents on the dollar. the settlement deal would resolve hundreds of the malpractice suits for just $5,000 each — even those from families suing on behalf of loved ones who they say died due to corizon's neglect. during the hearing, lopez obliquely referenced the suddenresignationof the bankruptcy court's chief justice, david jones, on sunday, saying, ""a lot has come out"" about the mediation process that led to the deal. insiderwas the first to report allegationsthat jones, who oversaw those talks, was involved in a previously undisclosed romantic relationship with a prominent bankruptcy attorney, elizabeth freeman, his former clerk. freeman represented yescare in the negotiations. ""i have no visibility into the mediation,"" ha nguyen, an attorney with the houston office of the us trustee, said at the hearing. ""but what we do know is that there was a lawyer involved with the mediator that was in the room. that fact is concerning to people."" the office of the us trustee, an arm of the justice department, took the rare step of filinga 16-page objectionto the settlement on friday. the objection not only raised the conflicts surrounding jones' mediation of the talks, but the unique disclosure needs of incarcerated plaintiffs. ""the circumstances of this case, with a vulnerable population of creditors that face obstacles to participation even on regular notice, weigh in favor of requiring more time,"" the objection reads. ""moreover, recent admissions by the judicial mediator may raise issues about the propriety of the mediation that serves as the basis for the global settlement — and thus about the very propriety of the settlement and plan itself."" the trustee's objection also raised concerns about the release from liability of multiple parties whose exact relationship to the entities involved in the two-step was not laid out in the disclosure statement. the proposed global settlement would protect tehum, yescare, and many of their current or former executives and directors from any future lawsuits related to corizon's care. if creditors approve it, more than 350 lawsuits alleging medical negligence over corizon's care at jails and prisons nationwide would be abruptly resolved. so would dozens of employment-lawsuits over allegations including discrimination, wage theft, and wrongful termination, along with claims regarding millions of dollars in unpaid invoices from hospitals and other health care providers. lopez said if his outstanding questions remain unanswered in the disclosure documents, he won't approve the disclosure package, or potentially even the underlying plan. ""there's not enough information here for me to feel comfortable that this disclosure statement — and maybe those parties don't want any more information disclosed — but that may mean other hard decisions get made,"" lopez said. ""sometimes the outcome is harsh, but that's where we are."" the son of hector garcia, who died in august 2019 at the age of 55 after receiving shoddy medical care from corizon at a jail in new mexico, according to his family's suit, told insider that he's thrilled by the judge's decision not to immediately approve the disclosure documents. hector garcia jr., who dialed in to the hearing, said he was blown away by the judge's words. ""it's like a complete 360 turnaround,"" he said. ""i'm so happy that our voice is being heard now.""",Neutral

""i think there have been saboteurs within the administration,"" brown told the times' astead w. herndon. ""i think that they are worried about the age contrast. and they are worried about kamala outshining biden."" over the past year, harris has been perhaps the administration's most forceful advocate for abortion rights, rallying women across the country after the supreme court voted tooverturnroe v. wade. the vice president has also beenan in-demand speakeramong college students — especially at historically black colleges and universities. biden has repeatedly praised harris' policy acumen and the strengths that he said she has brought to the administration,telling msnbcearlier this year that she ""hasn't gotten the credit that she deserves."" and when biden rolled out hisreelectionannouncement, she was front and center as he detailed why the ticket deserved to be reelected. but still, there have been questions about harris' viability as a future presidential contender and the potential face of the democratic party, especially as the party's post-biden 2028 primary is likely to attract a slew of candidates. brown — whose organization played a role in georgia voter organizing efforts ahead of sens. raphael warnock and jon ossoff victories in the state's january 2021 runoff elections — initially backed sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts over harris in the 2020 democratic presidential primary. but brown told the magazine that she believed she had underestimated harris at the time and later decided to fight hard for her selection as biden's running mate. and brown rejected the notion that biden's vow to select a female running mate — and the push for to him to tap a black woman — created a situation where some would discount harris' abilities. harris' 2021interviewwith nbc news anchor lester holt — where she was questioned about her lack of on-the-ground time at the us-mexico border and criticized over her response — remains on the minds of some voters who may be still be unsure of the vice president's main policy focus. but the administration has been unwavering in their support of harris, with white house senior advisor anita dunn telling the magazine that the vice president had some earlier stumbles but ""has found her voice, and she's found her role."" dunn also shut down any rumors that harris might be replaced as biden's running mate next year. ""this administration has never polled it,"" dunn told the magazine. ""never thought about it. never discussed it.""",Negative

""it is unfortunate that a terrible tragedy has been turned into this misguided prosecution,"" they said in a statement.  ""we will answer any charges in court."" mr baldwin had been practising firing the gun on the set of rust, a western, at a ranch near santa fe when it went off, fatally striking 42-year-old cinematographer halyna hutchins and wounding director joel souza. the actor said at the time that he drew back the hammer on the pistol, but did not pull the trigger. charges were dropped against mr baldwin six months ago after it was reported that the .45 colt revolver had been modified with a new trigger in a way that could have made a misfire more likely. prosecutors then had the replica gun forensically tested and had some parts of the weapon replaced after it was broken during the fbi's testing.  experts in ballistics and forensics based in arizona and new mexico concluded there was no way for the gun to have been fired without the trigger being pulled.  the special prosecutors leading the case, kari morrissey and jason lewis, said in a statement sent to bbc news on tuesday: ""after extensive investigation over the past several months, additional facts have come to light.""  ""we believe the appropriate course of action is to permit a panel of new mexico citizens to determine from here whether mr baldwin should be held over for criminal trial,"" they added.  in an interview with the new york times on tuesday, ms morrissey said that ""the forensic testing of the gun concluded with certainty that the trigger of the gun had to have been pulled for the gun to go off"". she added that prosecutors intend to begin presenting their case to a grand jury on 16 november.  the film's armourer, hannah gutierrez-reed, faces two counts of involuntary manslaughter.",Neutral

spanish names mean, respectively, ""large"" and ""rough."" butviewed from the zaragoza international bridge, which connects the cities of el paso, texas, and ciudad juárez, mexico, what was once mighty is now a dry riverbed, lined ominously with barbed wire.in the u.s., people often think of the rio grande mainly as a political border that features in negotiations over immigration, narcotics smuggling and trade. but there's another crisis on the river that receives far less attention. the river is in decline, suffering from overuse, drought and contentious water rights negotiations.urban and rural border communities with poor infrastructure,known in spanish as colonias, are particularly vulnerable to thewater crisis. farmers and cities insouthern texasandnorthern mexicoare also affected. as researchers who studyhydrologyandtransboundary water management, we believe managing this important resource requires closer cooperation between the u.s. and mexico.a hidden water crisisfor nearly 80 years, the u.s. and mexico have managed and distributed water from the colorado river and the lower rio grande—from fort quitman, texas, to the gulf of mexico—under the1944 water treaty, signed by presidents franklin d. roosevelt and manuel avila camacho. the colorado river was thecentral focus of treaty negotiationsbecause officials believed the colorado basin would have moreeconomic activityand population growth, so it would need more water. in fact, however, the rio grande basin has also seen significant growth.for the rio grande, the treaty allocates specific shares of water to the u.s. and mexico from both the river's main stem and its tributaries in texas and mexico. delivery of water from six mexican tributaries has become the source of contention. one-third of this flow is allocated to the u.s., and must total some 76 million cubic feet (2.2 million cubic meters) over each five-year period.the treaty allows mexico to roll any accrued deficits at the end of a five-year cycle over to the next cycle. deficits can only be rolled over once, and they must be made up along with the required deliveries for the following five-year period.the rio grande is one of the largest rivers in the southwest u.s. and northern mexico. because of drought and overuse, sections of the river frequently run dry. credit:kmusser/wikipedia,cc by-sathese five-year periods, called cycles, are numbered. cycles 25 (1992-1997) and 26 (1997-2002) were the first time that two consecutive cycles ended in deficit. like the colorado river, the rio grandehas become over-allocated: the 1944 treaty promises users more water than there is in the river. the main causes arepersistent droughtand increased water demand on both sides of the border.much of this demand was generated bythe 1992 north american free trade agreement, which eliminated most border tariffs between canada, the u.s. and mexico. from 1993 through 2007, agricultural imports and exports between the u.s. and mexico quadrupled, and there was extensive expansion ofmaquiladoras—assembly plants along the border. this growth increased water demand.ultimately, mexico delivered more than the required amount for cycle 27 (2002-2007), plus its incurred deficit from cycles 25 and 26, by transferring water from its reservoirs. this outcome appeased texas users but left mexico vulnerable. since then, mexico has continued to struggle to meet its treaty responsibilities and has experienced chronic water shortages.in 2020, a confrontation erupted in the state of chihuahua between the mexican national guard and farmers who believed delivery to texas of water from the rio conchos—one of the six tributaries regulated under the 1944 treaty—threatened their survival. in 2022, people lined up at water distribution sites inthe mexican city of monterrey, where the population had doubled since 1990. as of 2023, halfway through cycle 36, mexico has only deliveredsome 25% of its targeted amount.border politics overshadow water shortagesas climate change makes the southwest hotter and drier, scientists predict thatwater shortages on the rio grande will intensify. in this context, the 1944 treaty pits humanitarian needs for water in the u.s. against those in mexico.it also pits the needs of different sectors against one another. agriculture is thedominant water consumerin the region, followed by residential use. when there is a drought, however, the treaty prioritizes residential water use over agriculture.the rio grande is affected by nearly the same hydroclimate conditions as the colorado river, which flows mainly through the southwest u.s. but ends in mexico. however, drought and water shortages in the colorado river basin receive much more public attention than the same problems on the rio grande. u.s. media outlets cover the rio grande almost exclusively when it figures in stories about immigration and river crossings, such as texas gov. greg abbott's 2023 decision to installfloating barriersin the river at widely used crossing points.farmers as far north as colorado rely on water from the rio grande for irrigation.the compact that governs use of colorado river water has widely recognized flaws: the agreement is 100 years old, allocates more rights to water than the river holds, and completely excludes native american tribes. however, negotiations over the colorado between compact states and the u.s. and mexico are much more focused than decision-making about rio grande water, which has to compete with many other bilateral issues.adapting to the futureas we see it, the 1944 water treaty is inadequate to solve the complex social, economic, hydrological and political challenges that exist today in the rio grande basin. we believe it needs revision to reflect modern conditions.this can be done through theminute process, which permits mexico and the u.s. to adopt legally binding amendments without having to renegotiate the entire agreement. the two countries have already used this process to update the treaty as it pertains to the colorado riverin 2012andagain in 2017.these steps allowed the u.s. to adjust its deliveries of colorado river water to mexico based on water levels in lake mead, the colorado's largest reservoir, in ways that proportionally distributed drought impacts between the two countries. in the rio grande basin, mexico does not have similar flexibility.the u.s. also has the ability to proportionally reduce deliveries under aseparate 1906 agreementthat outlines water delivery from el paso to ciudad juarez. in 2013, for example,mexico received only 6%of the water it was due under the 1906 convention.enabling mexico to proportionally reduce rio grande deliveries according to drought conditions would distribute drought andclimate changeimpacts more fairly between both countries. as we see it, this kind of cooperation would deliver human, ecological and political benefits in a complex and contentious region.provided bythe conversationthis article is republished fromthe conversationunder a creative commons license. read theoriginal article.citation:

""rough."" butviewed from the zaragoza international bridge, which connects the cities of el paso, texas, and ciudad juárez, mexico, what was once mighty is now a dry riverbed, lined ominously with barbed wire.in the u.s., people often think of the rio grande mainly as a political border that features in negotiations over immigration, narcotics smuggling and trade. but there's another crisis on the river that receives far less attention. the river is in decline, suffering from overuse, drought and contentious water rights negotiations.urban and rural border communities with poor infrastructure,known in spanish as colonias, are particularly vulnerable to thewater crisis. farmers and cities insouthern texasandnorthern mexicoare also affected. as researchers who studyhydrologyandtransboundary water management, we believe managing this important resource requires closer cooperation between the u.s. and mexico.a hidden water crisisfor nearly 80 years, the u.s. and mexico have managed and distributed water from the colorado river and the lower rio grande—from fort quitman, texas, to the gulf of mexico—under the1944 water treaty, signed by presidents franklin d. roosevelt and manuel avila camacho. the colorado river was thecentral focus of treaty negotiationsbecause officials believed the colorado basin would have moreeconomic activityand population growth, so it would need more water. in fact, however, the rio grande basin has also seen significant growth.for the rio grande, the treaty allocates specific shares of water to the u.s. and mexico from both the river's main stem and its tributaries in texas and mexico. delivery of water from six mexican tributaries has become the source of contention. one-third of this flow is allocated to the u.s., and must total some 76 million cubic feet (2.2 million cubic meters) over each five-year period.the treaty allows mexico to roll any accrued deficits at the end of a five-year cycle over to the next cycle. deficits can only be rolled over once, and they must be made up along with the required deliveries for the following five-year period.the rio grande is one of the largest rivers in the southwest u.s. and northern mexico. because of drought and overuse, sections of the river frequently run dry. credit:kmusser/wikipedia,cc by-sathese five-year periods, called cycles, are numbered. cycles 25 (1992-1997) and 26 (1997-2002) were the first time that two consecutive cycles ended in deficit. like the colorado river, the rio grandehas become over-allocated: the 1944 treaty promises users more water than there is in the river. the main causes arepersistent droughtand increased water demand on both sides of the border.much of this demand was generated bythe 1992 north american free trade agreement, which eliminated most border tariffs between canada, the u.s. and mexico. from 1993 through 2007, agricultural imports and exports between the u.s. and mexico quadrupled, and there was extensive expansion ofmaquiladoras—assembly plants along the border. this growth increased water demand.ultimately, mexico delivered more than the required amount for cycle 27 (2002-2007), plus its incurred deficit from cycles 25 and 26, by transferring water from its reservoirs. this outcome appeased texas users but left mexico vulnerable. since then, mexico has continued to struggle to meet its treaty responsibilities and has experienced chronic water shortages.in 2020, a confrontation erupted in the state of chihuahua between the mexican national guard and farmers who believed

five-year cycle over to the next cycle. deficits can only be rolled over once, and they must be made up along with the required deliveries for the following five-year period.the rio grande is one of the largest rivers in the southwest u.s. and northern mexico. because of drought and overuse, sections of the river frequently run dry. credit:kmusser/wikipedia,cc by-sathese five-year periods, called cycles, are numbered. cycles 25 (1992-1997) and 26 (1997-2002) were the first time that two consecutive cycles ended in deficit. like the colorado river, the rio grandehas become over-allocated: the 1944 treaty promises users more water than there is in the river. the main causes arepersistent droughtand increased water demand on both sides of the border.much of this demand was generated bythe 1992 north american free trade agreement, which eliminated most border tariffs between canada, the u.s. and mexico. from 1993 through 2007, agricultural imports and exports between the u.s. and mexico quadrupled, and there was extensive expansion ofmaquiladoras—assembly plants along the border. this growth increased water demand.ultimately, mexico delivered more than the required amount for cycle 27 (2002-2007), plus its incurred deficit from cycles 25 and 26, by transferring water from its reservoirs. this outcome appeased texas users but left mexico vulnerable. since then, mexico has continued to struggle to meet its treaty responsibilities and has experienced chronic water shortages.in 2020, a confrontation erupted in the state of chihuahua between the mexican national guard and farmers who believed delivery to texas of water from the rio conchos—one of the six tributaries regulated under the 1944 treaty—threatened their survival. in 2022, people lined up at water distribution sites inthe mexican city of monterrey, where the population had doubled since 1990. as of 2023, halfway through cycle 36, mexico has only deliveredsome 25% of its targeted amount.border politics overshadow water shortagesas climate change makes the southwest hotter and drier, scientists predict thatwater shortages on the rio grande will intensify. in this context, the 1944 treaty pits humanitarian needs for water in the u.s. against those in mexico.it also pits the needs of different sectors against one another. agriculture is thedominant water consumerin the region, followed by residential use. when there is a drought, however, the treaty prioritizes residential water use over agriculture.the rio grande is affected by nearly the same hydroclimate conditions as the colorado river, which flows mainly through the southwest u.s. but ends in mexico. however, drought and water shortages in the colorado river basin receive much more public attention than the same problems on the rio grande. u.s. media outlets cover the rio grande almost exclusively when it figures in stories about immigration and river crossings, such as texas gov. greg abbott's 2023 decision to installfloating barriersin the river at widely used crossing points.farmers as far north as colorado rely on water from the rio grande for irrigation.the compact that governs use of colorado river

<… [+8694 chars]",Mexico,"a powerful group of senators have pressed for answers about the bankruptcy of the private prison healthcare provider formerly known as corizon health. in aletter sent tuesdayto executives of corizon's successor companies — yescare and tehum care services — the lawmakers say corizon employed an ""abusive"" bankruptcy strategy to avoid paying not just medical-malpractice lawsuits but also ""bills for tens of millions of dollars' worth of goods and services provided to corizon by hospitals, small businesses, and your own former employees."" the nine senators include elizabeth warren, bernie sanders, cory booker, judiciary committee chair dick durbin, and finance committee chair ron wyden. they raise questions in the seven-page letter about the company's ""largely anonymous investors,"" the company's ""obfuscation of its ownership structure,"" the assets it has transferred to ""affiliated entities,"" and its attempts to escape liability for hundreds of medical-malpractice lawsuits filed by current and former prisoners. ""the bankruptcy system has many aims, but it was not designed to provide an avenue for companies to evade accountability for wrongdoing,"" the lawmakers write. tehum filed for bankruptcy in february — the final step in a controversial legal maneuver in which corizon moved to texas and split in two. as a result of the tactic, dubbed the texas two-step, one company, called yescare, got all of corizon's corrections contracts while the other, tehum, was saddled with corizon's civil suits and most of its debt. insider first reported on the company'suse of the two-stepin august. in the letter, addressed to yescare ceo jeffrey sholey and isaac lefkowitz, tehum's sole director, the senators blasted corizon's attempt ""to manipulate bankruptcy law with the aim of skirting accountability for the harms that incarcerated individuals have endured under corizon's care."" ""the texas two-step is a distorted use of the u.s. bankruptcy system by corporations to evade mass tort liability,"" the senators write. ""your company has taken this abusive strategy a step farther."" the lawmakers urge sholey and lefkowitz to use ""the full financial capabilities"" of yescare, tehum, and other related entities to ""provide full relief for meritorious claims against corizon by all incarcerated people, their families, former employees, and third-party medical providers."" those claims total more than$1.2 billion, and tehum is seeking to settle them for $37 million. the senators have given tehum and yescare two weeks to answer nine detailed questions about their leadership, ownership structure, corporate assets, affiliated entities, the civil suits against them, and the bankruptcy settlement negotiations themselves. ""for too long, corporations like corizon have taken advantage of our bankruptcy system, engaging in maneuvers like the texas two-step to hide from victims who deserve to be treated fairly,"" sen. warren told insider. ""i'm calling for answers from corizon."" sholey, lefkowitz, yescare, and tehum did not immediately respond to requests for comment. corizon was once one of the nation's largest private prison healthcare providers, but claims of malpractice and patient neglect had been mounting against it for years. the senators excoriate corizon for its repeated failure to provide adequate healthcare to prisoners, itemizing what they describe as ""glaring instances of neglect."" the letter specifically mentions the case of hector garcia, a father of four who died three days into a six-day sentence at a new mexico jail, a caseinsider profiled. the letter says ""corizon providers ignored complaints of intense pain caused by an entirely treatable existing condition providers should have been aware of."" as his son hector garcia jr.told insider, ""it's not like he had a chance to call an ambulance himself."" the lawmakers' letter criticizes corizon's use of the texas two-step ""to pay pennies on the dollar to claimants that deserve recompense for poor health outcomes."" and it says serious questions remain about the opaque ownership behind yescare and tehum, issues first raised ininsider's reporting. ""reporting suggests that the largely unknown investors and associates that spearheaded the texas two-step have engaged in questionable and unjust tactics,"" the letter says. ""this misuse of the bankruptcy system is unacceptable, and we are concerned that it may result in the denial of hundreds of claims stemming from the substandard care incarcerated people have received under corizon's watch."" warren had already expressed concern about one company affiliate. in january 2021, shesent a letterto the national nursing home chain genesis healthcare, questioning why the company had paid top executives millions of dollars in bonuses even though it had received $300 million in government aid and more than 2,800 residents died on its watch during the pandemic. according toan alabama bid documentobtained by insider, yescare is managed and financially supported by geneva consulting llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of genesis. lefkowitz, the sole director of tehum, is now also a director at genesis. the bid says yescare entered into a management service agreement with geneva consulting — and the relationship between the two companies caught the senators' attention. they write that evidence suggests ""yescare may in fact be owned by geneva consulting or its parent, the nursing home giant genesis healthcare inc."" ""corizon's obfuscation of its ownership structure,"" they write, ""heightens our concern that the company is attempting to evade liability."" until recently, the bankruptcy looked to be on its way to a swift conclusion. tehum and its largest creditors had submitted a joint bankruptcy plan proposing the $37 million settlement, which would have given current and former incarcerated patients just $5,000 apiece for their medical-malpractice claims — even in cases where prisoners under corizon's care. then the judge who oversaw the settlement talks, david jones,suddenly resignedafter insider published allegations that he was inan undisclosed romantic relationshipwith an attorney who represented yescare in the negotiations. meanwhile, the us trustee program, in charge of watching over the integrity of the bankruptcy system,filed an objectionin bankruptcy court, citing jones' involvement in the mediation and other concerns. in the latest blow, christopher lopez, the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the case,said at a hearing last weekthat creditors needed more time to review the settlement — rejecting attempts by tehum's attorneys to expedite approval. so far, the company has attempted to wall off yescare's assets from tehum's creditors, claiming that the two companies are separate. the senators forcefully pushed back on that in the letter, writing that claims of ""corporate separateness"" are ""a transparent and unconvincing attempt to avoid adequately compensating victims."" warren and durbin have taken a hard line on the texas two-step, which was attempted most famously by johnson & johnson to try to shed tens of thousands of talc-powder lawsuits. five of the signers of tuesday's letter are members of the senate judiciary committee, which held a hearing last month on the two-step with the sharply worded title ""evading accountability: corporate manipulation of chapter 11 bankruptcy."" in july 2021, warren introduceda billthat would have amended us bankruptcy code to allow judges to dismiss a case if the bankrupt company had used a divisional merger over the prior 10 years in order to separate its assets from its liabilities. the divisional merger, legal only in texas and a few other states, is the maneuver underlying the two-step. durbin, sanders, booker, warren, and wyden were joined in tuesday's letter by democratic sens. richard blumenthal of connecticut, mazie hirono of hawaii, jeff merkley of oregon, and peter welch of vermont. yescare and tehum have until november 8 to respond.",Negative

“During the… [+2446 chars]",Nicaragua,"cuba accused the us of fomenting an economic crisis on the island and driving a record-breaking spike in outward migration through central america, in a statement released on wednesday. “during the last months and weeks, the irregular migratory flow of cuban citizens through the central american corridor bound for the united states has experienced noticeable growth,” the country’s foreign ministry said. a record number of cuban immigrants – 250,000, or more than 2% of the island’s population – arrived at the us southern border last year, mostly coming by land via nicaragua and mexico, according to us government data. while the number of cubans entering the us diminished slightly for a few months this year, as many opted for a new legal path to entry established by the administration of president joe biden, that “parole” pathway cannot accommodate all the cubans fleeing economic disaster in their homeland, havana warned. “the economic blockade, reinforced in recent years, causes extraordinary limitations to the cuban economy and the population’s standard of living, which stimulates the migration,” the ministry’s statement continued. the number of departures exceeds the total outward migration of the 1980 mariel boatlift and the 1994 rafter exodus combined and constitutes the largest migration event in the island’s modern history. while the administration of former president barack obama had begun normalizing relations with cuba after decades of the crippling cold war economic embargo, his successor donald trump reversed that process, reimposing a policy of “maximum pressure” on the caribbean island. the biden administration has given no indication it plans to end trade restrictions despite decades of international condemnation. it leveled further sanctions against havana in 2021 after authorities suppressed anti-government riots, which they claimed were us-backed. as a result, the island is facing critical shortages of food, fuel, and medicine, spurring record numbers of cubans to leave home in search of economic opportunities abroad. an unprecedented number of illegal immigrants have flowed into the us during the biden administration, with 260,000 migrant encounters reported by us customs and border protection last month alone – the highest monthly total ever recorded by the agency. there were a record 1.6 million crossings in 2022. while biden has grudgingly reimposed some of the strict border policies of his predecessor, he has also broadened legal avenues for migrants from certain countries considered unfriendly by the us – venezuela, nicaragua, and cuba among them – to enter legally.",Negative

""wounds from these are horrible. a whole leg can be removed. a shot to the body makes someone almost explode,"" the ukrainian soldier said, adding that russian apcs ""are easy to destroy but not good to fight directly."" medium-caliber cannon can engage infantry from a distance or even damage a tank — both of which are uses observed in ukraine, ""and it is apparent that infantry formations fare poorly against cannons if they are not supported,"" cranny-evans wrote. ""they also play an important role in urban warfare as they are capable of suppressing positions from ranges that are likely to be beyond the reach of the standard shoulder-fired anti-armor weapons carried by infantry formations."" people instinctively view the biggest cannon as the best in terms of firepower, but it's not that straightforward. a main battle tank like the us-made m-1 or the soviet-designed t-72 are armed with 120-mm or 125-mm guns that can destroy other tanks from miles away. but those tanks carry a limited number of cannon rounds and their main guns have a limited rate of fire. moreover, their main guns are ill-suited for many targets on the battlefield. during world war ii,80%of targets engaged by the m4 sherman tank were soft targets such as infantry, anti-tank guns, and bunkers. to send tanks after dispersed targets like infantry is like hunting rabbits with a howitzer. that's why tanks have machine guns in the 12.7-mm and 7.62-mm range, to engage personnel or to hit soft vehicles, such as trucks, that don't require a big cannon round. medium-caliber, rapid-fire cannon, such as the m242 bushmaster 25-mm chain gun on the us's m2 bradley infantry fighting vehicle, combine a rate of fire like that of a machine gun with the heavier shells used by a cannon. the 2a42 can pump out up 500 rounds a minute, while the27a2model can shoot 330 rounds. these weapons can also fire a variety of ammunition, including armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds. the m242 bushmaster can even fire depleted-uranium shells against tanks. bradleys famously used their 25-mm guns to suppress iraqi t-72 tanks, buying them time todestroy the iraqi tankswith the m2's tow anti-tank missiles. this doesn't mean that infantry fighting vehicles, if they have a choice, should pick a fight with heavily armored tanks, but medium cannon have proven their value. britain found 30-mm cannon useful in the falklands, cranny-evans wrote, adding that these weapons ""were also used as a form of precision direct fire in afghanistan where they served to quickly suppress taliban forces, and similar outcomes have been reported by french forces fighting in mali."" it's now common for infantry fighting and reconnaissance vehicles to carry guns that would have been the main armament of tanks in the early years of world war ii. future vehicles will still probably be armed with medium cannon, though with some innovations. the us and russia are looking at heavier 50-mm or 57-mm guns that use special ammunition such as the supershot, while cased telescoped cannon offer the prospect of smaller and lighter weapons. the us army also plans to arm thestrykerwith a 30-mm gun, while france and britain have ordered bae's40-mm cased telescoped cannonfor their light armored vehicles. however, nato, russia, and china (which copies russian weapons)are largely usingmedium-caliber cannon designed in the 1970s. as russia is still using cold war-era armored vehicles vulnerable to nato's current medium cannon — amongthose soviet-designed vehicles' many flaws— there may not be much impetus among western militaries to develop new weapons. nonetheless, ukraine has become a laboratory to demonstrate what happens when modern mechanized armies meet in battle. the effectiveness of medium-caliber cannons suggest that as armored vehicles evolve, those guns will remain part of their armament. michael peck is a defense writer whose work has appeared in forbes, defense news, foreign policy magazine, and other publications. he holds a master's in political science. follow him ontwitterandlinkedin.",Negative

""our models showed that with this range of climate policies, u.s. carbon emissions could decline by 29% to 50%, depending on the stringency of the carbon pricing. this represents 4.6% to 8% of global carbon emissions and satisfies the range of reductions outlined in the paris accord.""researchers also considered the additional benefits of restored wetlands to mitigate nitrogen loading to reduce hypoxia in the gulf of mexico and found a targeted wetland restoration scenario approximately doubles the effect of a low to moderatesocial costof carbon.the team hopes these findings provide important context for policy makers to consider all aspects of climate mitigation, as well as for those that want to consider alternatives for reducing contamination to the gulf of mexico.",Positive

""are you going to pay for that?"" he recalled the employee asking in what he said was a ""confrontational"" tone and manner. as other shoppers waited in line, the former us marine told insider he stifled a surge of embarrassment and pointed to the screen to show that the item in question had indeed been scanned, and his transaction was still in progress. ""it's a small military community,"" bisbee said. ""people remember people, so if they think you're stealing, it just gives a bad impression, even when you're not."" bisbee's father — a retired colonel — had also recently been stopped over a missed-scan alert for one of the three gallons of milk he was trying to buy. bisbee said his father was outraged by the interaction, and was so distracted he didn't realize he ended up paying for four gallons until he had left the store. the alert that brought the walmart worker over to bisbee's kiosk is part of amissed-scan detection featurethat the retailer began rolling out to self-checkout lanes starting in 2019 in an attempt to reduce shoplifting. the tech sends a message to workers monitoring the area when it detects behaviors it interprets as suspicious, which multiple current and former employees told insider has led to uncomfortable interactions and evenhostile confrontations with customers who trigger the system. even in cases where theft is suspected, the employees told insider they are not allowed to accuse customers of stealing. but many shoppers shared experiences in which honest mistakes or technical glitches resulted in them feeling branded as a criminal, whether by store workers, local law enforcement, or even the technology itself. ""we're continuously working on our security processes, and we encourage customers with concerns to let us know,"" walmart spokesperson joe pennington told insider. ""our associates are trained to handle these situations professionally and respectfully, ensuring our customers have the best shopping experience possible."" karen baker was pregnant and hurriedly shopping with her 4-year-old in tow when her kiosk kept intermittently freezing up over a missed scan. a former retail worker herself, she tried slowing down the pace to see if that helped. with the help of a manager, she eventually discovered the system was noticing her wallet, which was tucked in her armpit, and flagging it as unscanned merchandise. walmart doesn't even sell the same wallet, she added. shopper daniel jones told insider he was ""appalled"" when his kiosk lit up and began playing security video footage of an alleged missed scan. ""not only did i feel like i was being accused of a crime, i felt confused and upset because i was in my work uniform and other people may see the video playback and think that i'm stealing,"" jones said. waiting for an employee to come over, question him, and reactivate his system made jones feel like he was being ""punished"" for using the available hand scanner to ring up his order. (bisbee's missed-scan alert was also related to his use of the handheld scanner.) since the episode two weeks ago, jones said he has seen two other shoppers apparently caught off-guard and become defensive over the missed-scan alert. ""it does make the honest shopper feel unwelcome, and feel like they are being treated like thieves,"" he said. if you are a walmart worker or shopper who would like to share your perspective, please get in touch withdominick via email.insider strongly recommends using a personal email and a non-work device when reaching out.",Negative

""we're never sure when we're going to be here, when we're going to leave, you can't commit, we've had to cancel,"" said rep. marcy kaptur, who likely faces a competitive re-election in ohio next year. ""that's extremely unfair to the people i represent."" furthermore, democrats had to deal with an uncertain calendar driven by theups and downs of what happenedamong their republican colleagues, never knowing when votes might suddenly be called or when they might suddenly be sent home. ""it's not that we just sit around here and twiddle our thumbs,"" said rep. jim mcgovern of massachusetts. ""but the lack of certainty is frustrating. it's not like i haven't been productive, i think i have. but, you know, my wife doesn't know whether i'm coming home on the weekend or not."" ""canceling and uncanceling and canceling,"" said rep. abigail spanberger of virginia, describing the last three weeks. ""i have what feels like three scheduling meetings a day, because we're scheduling, unscheduling, scheduling, and unscheduling."" yet the three weeks without a speaker also had something of a silver lining for lawmakers, particularly given the hectic schedules they typically endure: more time to focus. ""the legislative team in particular has been able to focus on some of my priorities that we need to work on,"" said rep. chris deluzio of pennsylvania, another vulnerable democrat. ""but that's something they've gotta do anyway."" rep. gabe vasquez of new mexico said he's had more time engage with his staff back home via phone, and to fine-tune and gather support for a series of immigration-related bills he plans to roll out next week. ""we've gotten to do a lot of the policy stuff that we don't always get to do, since we're pretty busy up here,"" said rep. gabe vasquez of new mexico. but without the pressure of preparing for votes and committee meetings, he's also had time to get fit — and start hitting the gym. ""i've also been running a lot, four or five miles a day,"" said vasquez. ""i signed up for the gym. so yeah, i've been playing basketball down in the gym as well."" dogs have also made their way into the mix. balint said that a ""personal source of joy"" for her was getting to dog sit rep. sharice davids' rescue dog, peanut. ""he's super fast for a little three-legged guy,"" said balint. ""we'd be in a lot better place if the dogs were running the show here."" rep. angie craig of minnesota also brought her dog — a 5-month-old cavalier king charles spaniel named dakota — to the capitol for two weeks to serve as a kind of ""therapy dog"" for her colleagues, particularly during lengthy floor votes for speaker. ""dakota's been sharing her love around — on a bipartisan basis, by the way,"" said craig. ""i found out that [michigan republican rep.] lisa mcclain has a king charles spaniel too, so we've been comparing notes."" for rep. don beyer, whose home in his northern virginia district is just a 15-minute drive from the capitol, things haven't been so bad. he's been able to actually sit in on meetings with constituent groups — a task more typically delegated to staff members, given the congressman's busy schedule. ""i'm the most spoiled member of congress,"" said beyer. ""in many ways."" and ultimately, as each democrat took pains to make clear, it's not like democrats were totally sitting on their hands. the ongoing conflict in israel has meant more security briefings and organizing efforts, keeping some lawmakers just as busy as before. ""personally, i feel like i've been running around like our hair's on fire,"" said rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york, detailing israel-related phone calls with colleagues and biden administration officials. ""i don't know how the days have gotten filled up, but they have been absolutely, totally full,"" said spanberger, who said that she's been busy as a member of the house intelligence committee. ""there hasn't been a lot of downtime,"" said craig. ""it's funny in this place how no matter what's happening, we tend to fill it.""",Neutral

holiday tourism. paola cruz and her nephew, nicolas sanches gallardo, made a deal when they were kids playing in the hills of oaxaca, mexico. they agreed that, when one of them died, the other would seek out a mariachi band to play their favourite mexican songs at the funeral. but nicolas warned paola that if he died first and she didn’t honour the pact, he would travel back to the world of the living ondia de los muertos— mexico’sday of the deadholiday — just to give her the scare of her life. paola is now 70, her short silver hair trimmed tightly above her dark, soulful eyes. she remembers the last day of the dead she spent with nicolas, her junior by only six years. nicolas, his wife and his children had gathered at paola’s house in the santa rosa district of oaxaca for a holiday feast: handmade tortillas, slow-cooked beans, oaxacan stews and pan de muerto, a sugar-encrusted bread that nicolas made specially for the occasion. but when nicolas declined his usual glass of mezcal, an agave-based alcohol, paola was surprised. “he told me his chest started to hurt that morning but said i shouldn’t worry,” she recalled. “his heart, according to him, was simply heavy with the love he felt for his wife.” two weeks later, nicolas died of a heart attack at age 52. paola made sure an eight-member mariachi band performed at his funeral in the santa rosa cemetery. it was 2011, 45 years after they struck their pact. “nico could make us cry with laughter even during the sad moments of dia de los muertos,” paola remembered. “we think of him a lot during this time.” for many in mexico and its diaspora communities, the day of the dead — generally held on november 1 and 2 — is an occasion to remember and celebrate loved ones like nicolas who have passed away. during the holiday, families welcome the dead back from the underworld with offerings at their graves: a favourite snack, perhaps, or a much-loved drink. and cemeteries are festooned with candles and flowers in vivid shades of orange and violet. “occasionally, strange things happen around me during these times,” paola said. “i feel things brush past me or hear strange noises in the house. it’s a little unnerving at first but also a comfort.” paola’s grandson jonathan velasco remarked that even the chillier autumn weather seems to evoke the underworld. “it’s ‘frio de muerto’ or the cold of the dead,” he said from paola’s garden, where a cool breeze shook acai berries from a drooping palm leaf. “here in oaxaca, the change in climate signifies it’s time to prepare for the dead to arrive.” in anticipation of this year’s day of the dead, paola and her family assembled their ofrenda, a candlelit altar she keeps in her home, right beside her dining table. it contains mementos from the past and photographs of her deceased family members, including nicolas, who smiles up from a snapshot where he has one arm wrapped around paola. “it’s a mixture of emotions every year,” paola explained as she weaves through her garden, clipping flowers for the ofrenda with her seven-year-old great-granddaughter, sophia. “but i think this year, people close to me who have died would be happy for me to talk about them.” paola’s hometown of oaxaca is considered an epicentre for day of the dead festivities, with parades and live music taking place across the city. the southern state in which it is situated — also named oaxaca — has the largest indigenous population in all of mexico, and the holiday is often seen as a fusion of european and pre-hispanic traditions. but while residents like paola keep local customs alive, the day of the dead has become an increasingly international phenomenon. in 2022, secretary of tourism miguel torruco marques estimated that2.16 million touristswould arrive in mexico for the holiday, up 95 percent over the same time in 2019. that influx was set to generate profits of 37.7 billion pesos, roughly the equivalent of $2bn. the holiday’s popularity has surged in part due to appearances in films like the disney-pixar animated feature coco and the james bond movie spectre. but that spotlight has translated into fears the holiday could become too commercialised. since 2019, the toy company mattel has released an annual day of the dead-themed barbie doll. and in 2013, disney was forced to drop a bid to trademark the phrase “dia de los muertos” amid public outcry. still, in oaxaca, 71-year-old farmer genaro lopez is optimistic about the increase in attention. flashing an open smile beneath his well-groomed, grey handlebar moustache, lopez said he feels pride in sharing his traditions with visitors. born and raised in zimatlan de alvarez, a town 30km (18 miles) south of oaxaca’s city centre, lopez has been growing “floras de muerte” or “flowers of the dead” for almost 40 years. his farm is home to rows of fragrant cempasuchil — orange marigolds — and maroon cockscombs. one is said to attract souls from the dead with its scent, while the other represents the blood of christ. “these flowers are my life’s work. i sow the seeds in july so they’re ready for the end of october,” lopez explained. but his business took a hit during the covid-19 pandemic. in 2020, lopez lost almost 30 percent of his usual sales. but since then, he said he has planted more and more seeds each year to keep up with the rapidly increasing demand for flowers. “now i can relax and enjoy watching the happiness they give families as they take bunches back to decorate their altars, local cemeteries and their homes,” lopez said. another local business owner, anthony garcia, has likewise seen demand grow far beyond expectations. he creates “monos de calenda”, giant puppets dressed in traditional clothing that are paraded during street parties and other cultural events. it was a craft garcia took up as a child, learning from his grandmother, and he launched the hobby into a business six years ago. “i’ve had to turn down more clients than ever this year due to demand,” garcia said. he explained he recently created 28 “monos” for a mexican restaurant chain in london. “it’s my favourite time, both professionally and personally.” as for paola, this year will be calmer than usual. she will visit cemeteries during the day to avoid the huge crowds at night and spend more time at home rather than participate in street parades in her area. she wants to “enjoy the peaceful moments more”, she said, unless she senses the presence of her late husband, who passed away in 2017. “then i’ll be ready to tell him off for leaving without me!”

""an annular eclipse only happens when the moon is at its furthest away point from earth. in perspective to us on earth, it doesn't completely block out the light from the sun so instead you get this incredible ring of fire around the moon.

""no plausible path for us-china trade should put downward pressure on us inflation comparable to what was observed during the 2000s,"" the authors wrote. however, jpmorgan researchers found that the inflationary impact of doing less business with china will likely be relatively small in the near term — up to 10 to 20 basis points each year between now and 2032.that's the equivalent of a 3.0% annual inflation figure being 3.1% or 3.2%. efforts to ""friend shore"" — or shift some manufacturing and trade tous allies like mexico— could help offset some price pressures. since the turn of the century,cheaper overseas manufacturing costsin countries like china have driven down us prices for goods like smartphones, tvs, and computers. even for companies that continued to make goods in the us, buying supplies from overseas helped keep prices down. between 2000 and 2010, the surge in chinese imports reduced us inflation by roughly 40 basis points per year, jpmorgan's researchers said, relative to a more modest import growth scenario. but times have changed and recent global factors have pushed us corporations tobring their supply chains closer to home. these events include pandemic-erasupply chain nightmares, russia's invasion of ukraine, and chinese national security and human rights concerns. the ongoing war betweenisrael and hamascould expedite these efforts. last year, 364,000 jobs were ""reshored"" in the us, according to areportby the reshoring initiative, a non-profit that tracks manufacturing data, and whose mission is to bring high-paying jobs back to the us. this number, which was up 53% from 2021's record-highfigure, included jobs that had been previously done in other countries and those created in the us by foreign-owned corporations. more jobs could be on the way. construction spending by us manufacturersmore than doubledbetween june 2022 and april 2023, according to census bureau data. us shoppers aren't the only ones who should be closely monitoring the impacts of reshoring, jpmorgan's paper reported. that's because higher prices could make it more difficult for thefederal reserve to cool inflation. ""if the fed lacks the ability or willingness to anticipate and neutralize the effect of this supply shock, it could lead to higher inflation,"" the report said. even if reshoring has a modest impact on inflation over the next year, every little bit matters in the fed's fight to hit its long-term2% inflation target. ""inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal,"" federal reserve president jerome powell said to the economic club of new york last week. if the fed anticipates these price pressures and keeps interest rates higher for longer, this could help keep inflation in check. but even this could have a downside for americans. higher interest rates are making it difficult for many people tobuy a homeandmeet their car payments. ""monetary policy could be more restrictive than otherwise for the duration of the shock,"" the report said.",Negative

<ul><li>Retailers hoped to save big on labor costs by intro… [+4453 chars]",Mexico,"self-checkout may not be the money-saving ""revolution"" some retailers were hoping for. more than 30 years after the introduction ofself-checkoutand its promises of labor-cost savings, the tech has become ubiquitous in stores across the us. now, retailers includingcostco, walmart, and kroger are rethinking some of their self-checkout strategies. some are finding they still need employees to combat theft, assist with purchases, review ids, andcheck receipts. costco, for example, has started asking staff to check membership cardsin the self-checkout lanes, as well as assist with scanning items. the company said the move would help crack down on shoppers improperly sharing memberships at self-checkout registers. costco relies on membership fees for most of its profit. walmart said last week it waspulling self-checkoutfrom at least three stores in albuquerque, new mexico, and replacing the lanes with traditional staffed registers. the company didn't elaborate on reasons for the change and said it had no plans for ""widespread"" removal of self-checkout. walmart started rolling out a hybrid approach to self-checkout in 2020. the redesigned checkout zones replaced traditional lanes with a staffed corral of kiosks where shoppers could opt to scan and pay on their own or have a worker do it for them. a press release touted the redesign's human touch. ""in this new layout, you get greeted from the entranceway and helped all the way through the whole process,"" a store manager said in a release. ""we will go to any register, and we will help you in any fashion you want, whether it's checking out one item or all the items. any questions you have, we're right there for you."" like what is the point of self checkout if i cant scan one take one  jk#fyp#miraclehandz#wilmingtondelaware#wilmington#miraclehandzgrowthoil@ kroger, meanwhile, is goingall in on self-checkoutin at least one store where it's no longer offering traditional registers. but kroger told retail dive the change didn't result in labor cuts, and it still had front-end staff to assist with scanning and bagging groceries. this isn't exactly the labor-minimizing tech retailers were promised. kroger, walmart, and costco didn't respond to a request from insider for additional details on their self-checkout strategies. industry estimates suggest inventory losses can rise by31% to 60%— or more — depending on the number of self-checkout stations used in a store. matt kelley, a loss-prevention expert who worked in asset protection at home depot, told insider last year that self-checkout forced retailers to make a trade-off between labor-cost savings and the increased expense of theft. ""inherently, that means there's going to be less eyes on a transaction,"" kelley, who's now with liveview technologies, added at the time. ""and there's going to be more of an opportunity for the dishonest people to be dishonest."" walmart and kroger use sophisticated video-monitoring and sensor tech to track merchandise through stores and self-checkout lanes. but some shoppers told insider they stillsaw unpaid items pass without raising alarm. missed or skipped scans are not always intentional — people and machines make mistakes. in any case, the solution appears to be the same: assigning employees to monitor and assist customers. christopher andrews, a drew university sociologist who wrote ""the overworked consumer,"" toldcnnlast year that, far from being the autonomous money collectors retailers were hoping for, self-checkout stations required supervision, maintenance, and it support. self-checkout ""delivers none of what it promises,"" he told the outlet. to be sure, many retailers are still investing in the technology. but some appear to be reconsidering how they use it and whether to bring more humans into the process so it runs smoothly.",Neutral

Franklin
<ul><li>Kari Lake on Tuesday launched her bid for the Republican Senate nominatio… [+5357 chars]",Mexico,"last october, kari lake campaigned with an air of inevitability as she proposed a transformational arizona governorship where she would pursue election reform and fight drug cartels along the us-mexico border. lake, a former television journalist, enjoyed the backing of former president donald trump, and rumorsswirledthat she'd potentially be tapped to be his vice presidential running mate in 2024. but she narrowlylostthe race to now-democratic gov. katie hobbs, an election result that sheunsuccessfullychallenged in court. as one of the most vocal proponents of trump'sdebunked claimsregarding the 2020 presidential election, lake repeatedly found fault in the gubernatorial results of her own race. so when lake announced her senate candidacy on tuesday, it was a surprise to many that she barely spoke about election fraud, only referring to election integrity in bipartisan terms. and a week earlier, she visited washington to speak with gop leaders about the race, a scenario that would have seemed unlikely months ago. here's how lake is aiming to pull off a rebrand as she looks to join the senate: the first big thing to note is that lake, despite any sort of moderation with her language, is still a favorite of trump. she proudly touted the former president'sendorsementon tuesday, showing a video of him backing her campaignduring the kickoff. (the move likely dooms the prospects of blake masters, the unsuccessful 2022 senate nominee who the wall street journalpreviously reportedhad been set to jump into the 2024 senate race.) but with the realization that she'll be running in one of the most competitive swing states in the country, she eschewed any fixation on ""fraud"" and instead emphasized a desire for election integrity. ""fighting for honest elections is not a republican issue. it's not a democrat issue. it's an american issue,"" she said at the rally. while lake may still harbor resentment toward her own gubernatorial loss, the electorate in 2024 will be focused on the future — and not on the 2022 results. lake during her 2022 campaign ran as someone far removed from the traditional arizona-style republicanism defined by politicians like former gov. doug ducey, former sen. jon kyl, and the late sen. john mccain. she reveled in the fact that she won the gop gubernatorial primary over the establishment's choice, attorney and former arizona board of regents member karrin taylor robson. but as lake looks to 2024 — in what will be an expensive race should she win the gop senate nomination — she has already met with key washington republicans. politico on wednesdayreportedthat during lake's visit to capitol hill, she spoke with sen. john barrasso of wyoming, the chair of the senate republican conference, along with sen. john cornyn of texas. and lake also met with sen. steve daines of montana, the chair of the national republican senatorial committee, according to politico. seeking inroads with allies of senate minority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky will only help lake down the line if she secures the gop nomination. lake may find herself in a unique contest with independent sen. kyrsten sinema — who officiallyleftthe democratic party last year but has largely maintained a similar voting record — and democratic rep. ruben gallego. gallego remains the favorite to win the democratic nomination, while sinema has not yet announced if she'll seek reelection. but a three-way contest may benefit gallego the most, as recent polling suggests that sinema could actually pull more support from a republican candidate than gallego. inan emerson college pollreleased in august, before lake entered the race, gallego led with 36% support, followed by republican pinal county sheriff mark lamb (who'sbeen in the racesince april) at 29% and sinema with 21% support — while 15% of respondents were undecided. as more polling reflective of lake's entry into the race emerges, it'll offer a better view of lake's competitiveness in the senate contest. in last year's gubernatorial election, lake earned 49.6% of the vote, losing by about 17,000 votes out of nearly 2.6 million ballots cast. but the dynamics in 2024 will be different, and in a three-way contest, lake will need to appeal to the independents and moderate republicans who turned away from her campaign last year. in lake's speech on tuesday, early signs of such an effort were seemingly underway as she focused heavily on the economic concerns of arizonans across the political spectrum. ""there is not a gas pump out there for republicans, and one for democrats, right?"" she told the crowd. only time will tell if lake can convince many swing voters to give her a second look.",Neutral

<ul><li>It's no surprise that Exxon opted to buy Pionee… [+4788 chars]",Mexico,"exxonmobil's $60 billion bet that the world will be hooked on fossil fuels for decades is looking like a safe one — at least financially. ceo darren woods has long said that fossil fuels will be central to the world's energy mix for the foreseeable future. the company's acquisition of pioneer natural resources, the largest oil and gas producer in the permian basin that spans from west texas into new mexico, further entrenches exxon in that future. ""this is proof of exxon's strategy to stay in oil and gas as long as possible,"" mark van baal, founder of the activist shareholder group follow this, told insider. ""it shows that the company doesn't think there's any chance the world will achieve the paris agreement, because if they did, they wouldn't buy new assets."" nearly 200 countries adopted the paris agreement in 2016 that aims to limit global temperatures from rising above catastrophic levels. thousands of the world's largest companies made similar promises. yet greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise,largely driven by burning fossil fuels. renewables like solar and wind are gaining ground, but not fast enough, according to climate and energy analysts. oil majorsare under less pressure from investorsand asset managers to accelerate their decarbonization plans after earning record profits last year. the war in ukraine sent energy prices soaring and led europe to search for new gas suppliers. meanwhile, the world is still approving new oil and gas projects,with the us leading the way. big banksare willing to finance that expansion, even as they pledge to achieve net-zero emissions on their balance sheets by 2050. given the trends, it's no surprise that exxon opted to buy pioneer. many of the company's oil and gas fields are still untapped, and new wells pay back in less than two years, analysts at wood mackenzie said in a note. if the deal gets antitrust approval, exxon would immediately double its supplies to 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, with a goal to boost production to 2 million barrels a day by 2027. the deal secures decades of supply for exxon's growing plastics, chemicals, and liquified natural gas businesses, according to wood mackenzie, a global research and consultancy firm. exxon already had plans to ramp up production in the permian basin before announcing the deal, even as pioneer's ceo scott sheffieldearlier this year predictedthat oil production could peak in the permian in five to six years. us oil majors have resisted pressure to diversify into renewables like solar and wind, arguing that natural gas is a transition fuel because it produces fewer emissions than coal. exxon has instead focused on reducing methane leaks along its infrastructure and developing nascent technology that captures carbon emissions at power plants. but those investments are a fraction of exxon's spending on oil and gas development through 2027, whichwill account for some 70% of capital expenditures. exxon didn't respond to insider's request for comment. the international energy agency for the first time in september predicted that fossil fuels — which meet 80% of the world's energy demand — will hit peak demand this decade. ""our latest projections show that the growth of electric vehicles around the world, especially in china, means oil demand is on course to peak before 2030,"" fatih birol, executive director of the iea,said in an op-ed in the financial times. even so, fossil fuels are still expected to account for half of the world's energy mix by 2050, which is nowhere near the steep drop that's needed to hit global climate goals. exxon recentlyforecast that oil, gas, and coal will account for 68% of the energy mixby that date. some analysts viewed the exxon-pioneer merger as a sign that an era of major fossil fuel growth is coming to a close. they predicted similar mergers on the horizon for other companies like chevron and shell. ""this deal is about scale and efficiency,"" andrew logan, senior director of oil and gas at ceres, a sustainability nonprofit that works with investors, told insider. he added that exxon could've made a worse deal, given its clear track record of doing little to tackle climate change. the deal reflects how many investors think they have to choose between profits and protecting the planet, van baal said. ""i really think that shareholders should think again about how they deal with the oil industry,"" van baal said. ""they will have to pay for the consequences eventually.""",Negative

Her journ… [+14001 chars]",Mexico,"a ukrainian refugee named anzelika akimova enters her fighting stance at the eastern block boxing gym in los angeles. in front of a neon logo of a screaming eurasian brown bear, she's channeling a hypnotic rhythm that's interrupted only by booming drill instructions or the beep of a timer. the gym has the brutalist black-and-white aesthetic of a russian nightclub. akimova, her blue eyes laser-focused, cannons her left-handed jab, and a tattoo of angel wings sprawled across her back contracts and expands. she got the tattoo months after arriving in the us as a nod to both her name, rooted from the word ""angel,"" and her new home, los angeles. in los angeles and across california, front yards don ukrainian flags and cars are adorned with bumper stickers extending solidarity to the population under russia's assault, which intensified after the country's full-scale invasion in february 2022 andhas displaced over 6 million people. the outpour of american support for ukrainian refugees has been profound, mainly through a sponsorship program rolled out in april 2022 by president joe biden's administration, through which 1.7 million americans have offered to help resettle ukrainians. but beyond the gestures and political efforts, akimova and many new ukrainian immigrants hold trauma from the raging war and are now grappling with slow bureaucracy and anxiety around fragile immigration statuses, as well as a heightened cost of living in the us. many, like akimova, are feeling the crushing weight of starting over. it wasn't until she discovered a russian-speaking gym that she started to find her footing again. it was only 18 months ago when akimova, 33, thought her days were numbered, first because of the war and later, in the us, the paralyzing limbo of losing her sense of place. after russia's invasion in early 2022, and during her first months in the us, akimova said, she hated that americans could keep a positive outlook on life while she stayed up late, sending whatsapp messages to relatives in odesa and kyiv, trying to start her new life after resettling. she missed the mundane in odesa, even how the acrid smell of her neighbors frying tinned goby fish would waft through the calm seaside air and into her home, uninvited. she missed the rigor of her daily karate practice and often thought about her and her 12-year-old daughter, arina's, karate coach, who once told her the only time it was ok to miss a workout was when you die. she felt close enough to that, she said. no matter how excited her daughter was about disneyland and life in the us, depression ate away at akimova. but five months into her time in the us, she met someone who reinvigorated that sense of adrenalized regiment and purpose into her life. without much to do, and too much time to doomscroll, akimova followed an algorithmic thread on instagram that led her to the page of a boxing gym that was set to open in toluca lake, near north hollywood, where she resettled. that's where she met her boxing trainer, salman poddubnov, 35, a man who came from — who escaped — the same country that invaded her homeland. by january 2023, akimova joined his gym and felt born again. ""it was like being underwater for a long time, and then coming up for air,"" she remembered telling her sister, still in ukraine, over a late-night phone call through which air sirens could be heard in the background. akimova's sing-songy voice shifts from a bubbly tone to exasperation in seconds as she reflects on her journey from a war that has raged in some form since 2014. ten days into russia's full-scale invasion of ukraine, akimova found herself and her daughter sheltering from warplanes in the underground parking garage of their apartment building in odesa, she told insider. she was sick with a cold, and her fridge was empty. within 24 hours, grocery stores in her city were out of food, and the pharmacies, which she hadn't had time to pass by in the days before the invasion, were out of medicine. she worried, too, that her daughter would get pneumonia sleeping on the frigid concrete where cars parked, with just a few blankets to keep her warm. her idyllic lifestyle — working as a teacher, later designing floral arrangements, and finally as a makeup artist — faded away, and she decided to create the safest possible life for herself and her daughter. they trudged 5 miles by foot from a border crossing backed up with cars to the other side of the moldovan border, where they were met by some of her karate teammates from ukraine, who helped them get tickets aboard a rickety train to romania. the train was repurposed to help resettle migrants at the start of the full-scale invasion. its roof was riddled with holes. it was the first time they could fall asleep — on each other's shoulders, with no fear of bombardment — in days. in romania, akimova and her daughter waited for half a day until a czech relative arrived and invited them to live with them in prague for a month. then, akimova and her daughter took the leap and decided to try to gain entry into the us and join akimova's partner, a ukrainian who lives in los angeles. they flew to mexico, where they first tried to cross the border at tijuana, but turned away when they saw the crowds at the crossing. they were later driven by ukrainian volunteers to the mexicali-calexico border, where, after four hours, they were granted humanitarian parole in the us. the journey was arduous, and the following months weighed heavily on akimova as she tried to make sense of her new immigration status and navigate with minimal english skills. after enlisting in esl classes and registering her daughter in a public school, her day-to-day life in los angeles felt more stable. still, she ached for her homeland. her attempts to make tvarog, a pillowy fermented farmer's cheese popular in ukraine, didn't help. begrudgingly picking up ingredients from a russian store, she mixed the warmed milk with vinegar as she always had, watching the whey separate and the cheese curdle. but when she strained the fluffy mixture with cheesecloth and added buttermilk, something was off — either the american buttermilk or the absence of odesa's water. it wasn't until she set foot in poddubnov's gym that she felt at home. ""in my country when i practiced karate, i was really organized: if you have a problem, you should go work out; if you're happy, you should go work out; if you need to solve a problem, you should work out,"" akimova told insider. ""it was like medicine for everything. and here, it's the same."" akimova is one of the more than 270,000 ukrainians who have arrived in the us since russia invaded ukraine. at least 25,000 of them entered the us through the southern border in 2022, before the us government established the uniting for ukraine program in april of that year, according to the nonprofit lutheran immigration and refugee service. but the bulk of new ukrainians — at least 146,000 fleeing the war — have been resettled through the parole program, according to lirs. the sponsorship program allows ukrainians to live in the us for two years on a faster track to citizenship. more than 1.7 million americans have applied to be sponsors, lirs told insider. krish o'mara vignarajah, the president of lirs, told insider that parole status did not necessarily create a clear path to be granted asylum and later permanent residency. so in august, the department of homeland securityextendedtemporary protected status for ukrainians until april 2025, providing more options for ukrainians to try to extend their refuge in the us. in july 2022, akimova and arina were granted tps, which made their place in the us slightly more rooted. but there are still uniting factors making life in the us difficult for many new ukrainians like akimova, regardless of immigration status. for one, akimova and arina arrived at a time whenhistoric 8.3% inflationcaused the cost of living in the us to skyrocket, especially compared to the cost of living in ukraine. and many parolees that arrived are women and children, according to lirs, creating issues in terms of securing childcare and employment. on a weekly basis, akimova has been working against the clock with her immigration lawyer, trying to secure an extension to her and arina's tps status. ""in general, we've seen the ukrainians we serve struggle with the uncertainty of what will happen after parole and whether they will be approved for another status like tps or asylum,"" vignarajah told insider. ""ukrainians are also experiencing the trauma of losing their homes and being separated from family and loved ones."" increasingly, akimova's future here is materializing after a relative shipped akimova's master's degree to her home in los angeles — which allowed her to begin community college classes in english and art in the late summer. the gym, too, has been poddubnov's place of refuge. it's marked with the slogan ""no nationality, no skin color, no politics: only boxing."" he cuts a stoic and alert figure in the gym, in one breath shouting instructions, cracking a joke in the next, over a rotating soundtrack of russian tech house or american gangster rap. before their paths aligned at eastern block boxing, poddubnov fought as an amateur boxer in russia. he later entered local politics, getting a job as a vice mayor in the industrial russian city of volzhsky, a dozen miles from the famed world war ii battle of stalingrad. ""my life was pretty good,"" poddubnov told insider. ""if it wasn't for politics, maybe i'd still be there. in russia, if you don't agree with something, you will go to jail; you have a choice: jail or usa."" poddubnov told insider he was run out as volzhsky's vice mayor in 2016, after that year's legislative and state elections, as vladimir putin's allies took over the region's governorship and brought a corruption case against him and local mayors, clearing house and ensuring that allies took their spots. the same year, what he felt was a phony corruption case against him was heating up, poddubnov would kiss his young daughter one last time late at night and take a flight to the us with $3,000 and hopes of reviving his boxing career. but soon after arriving in the us, he mixed with the wrong crowd, he told insider, and served close to two years across six federal prisons after he became a driver involved in a 25-person money-laundering ring run by eastern europeans across the us, according to court documents. while in the prison system, poddubnov trained groups of men and was encouraged by fellow prisoners to open his own gym after his release. in december of last year, after over a year of freedom and training clients in his backyard, poddubnov opened eastern block boxing. the soviet style is characterized by long-distance jabs and straight right hands, hooks with palms facing down, a pendulum step, and shifty angular footwork. it was popularized by the height of the cold war and shared by former members of the soviet union and is still used by ukrainian and russian fighters, as well as fighters from other former soviet countries. ""beautiful,"" poddubnov says to akimova during their training one balmy summer morning. ""this is soviet union boxing, keeping your distance."" multiple times a week, akimova tells poddubnov what is going on with her community in ukraine, and they lament how close many russians and ukrainians were before the war. on her instagram, akimova routinely speaks out against the war, calling russia a ""terrorist state"" for its actions. poddubnov agrees with the political assessment. ""it's very good that we live here, on the other side,"" poddubnov told insider. ""here you see it like a tennis match, and you can understand what is going on. in russia, people don't see this, they see the 'special military operation.'"" poddubnov doesn't plan to go back to russia any time soon, in part because he fears he may be conscripted. ""for what would i go? to kill her family? what did they do to me?"" poddubnov said as akimova looked down solemnly. by august, akimova secured full travel authorization outside the us — and she considered visiting relatives in odesa and kyiv for two weeks. instead, she registered for more community college classes. her home is now in los angeles and in the boxing gym.",Neutral

""this is in a village that had been occupied twice,"" she explained, showing the republican staffer photos of a school that, ""as you can see, has just been demolished."" ""i can show you three more schools that look that bad or worse,"" she added. ""the pictures don't even do it justice. i mean, it's unreal."" another activist came with a reminder that ukraine, though a victim, is capable of defending itself. he had a bookmark, handmade in bucha — where occupying russian forces are believed to haveexecuted hundreds of civilianslast year — but fashioned not out of paper but the plastic container used to hold one of the 155mm artillery shells that the united states has shipped to ukraine since february 2022. ""it was fired during the summertime,"" he explained. ""we were told to bring that stuff back and thank americans."" the pair of activists — paige barrows, who fell in love with ukraine while serving in the peace corps, returning a few months back to deliver humanitarian aid, and ryan meyer, who quit an office job in oklahoma to spend most of the last year helping deliver supplies to front-line communities — were in washington with hundreds of others for a summit aimed at bolstering support in both parties for providing the means for kyiv to beat back the russian invasion. on the day of their meeting, the house of representatives was still without a speaker, in part due to an internal gop fight over ukraine. a majority of republican lawmakers are no longer so sure, at least publicly, that defending kyiv from the kremlin is in america's strategic interests. on tuesday,hundreds of pro-ukraine activists, including a ukrainian soldierusing his vacation time, were on capitol hill to reverse that trend, urging lawmakers to support president joe biden's proposal for an additional $60 billion in aid, much of it to replenish depleted us arms stockpiles, and other legislation aimed at undermining russia's war effort. one measure, which activists stressed in their meetings, would authorize the biden administration totransfer the kremlin's frozen assetsto ukraine, effectively answering a right-wing critique — ""why should we pay for this?"" — by suggesting that russia foot the bill for ukraine's reconstruction. sen. markwayne mullin of oklahoma, who the activists met with tuesday afternoon, is about as conservative as they come, advocating a national ban on abortion and,in 2021, citing false claims of voter fraud to justify throwing out electoral votes from some battleground states. but unlike some louder voices in his party, including former president donald trump (who he endorsed earlier this year), mullin has been a reliable supporter of ukraine, something he didn't shy away from when campaigning last year against a pair ofrepublican primary opponentswho were either skeptical or outright opposed to more aid. in september, politicoreported thatmullin also appeared to have convinced his republican colleagues in the house, at least temporarily, not to hold up aid to ukraine over other political concerns, namely the us-mexico border. a member of the senate armed services committee, mullin's support appears steadfast. the senator posed for a photo tuesday with a ukrainian flag and told activists at the meeting — attended by insider — that he plans to visit the country again early next year. scenes of war and its devastation, the senator said, are not something one can soon forget. ""it's a different world,""he said on tuesday [to the activists? during the meeting?]. ""when you see it and smell it, and you see just what humans are capable of doing, it takes away that innocence."" whether mullin's constituents will remain on board, however, is another question. republican lawmakers are responding to concerns expressed by republican voters — the people who will ultimately decide their political future. a majority of them are telling pollsters that enough is enough. ""mixed."" that's how jack a. edwards, a legislative aide to mullin, described the calls that the senator's office has been receiving about ukraine in recent weeks. there's been support, opposition, and support but with concerns about oversight, he said. ""oklahoma's no different than the rest of the country there."" what helps, he continued, is visits from activists like barrows and meyer, who can share information gleaned from their own trips to ukraine. such anecdotes can better inform lawmakers about the reality on the ground — and how us support makes a difference — but also, those lawmakers can, in turn, better inform their voters and shape the narratives in conservative and mainstream media. kate tremont, a pro-ukraine activist who lives in washington, told insider that's something friends of the country will need to focus on going forward, especially as partisanship increases ahead of the 2024 election. ""it's human nature to feel separated from something so far away, and i think that's both a thing that works against us and a thing that we can use by finding ways to connect people,"" she said, speaking as a jazz ensemble played at a reception for activists at the ukraine house, which works with the ukrainian embassy to promote the country's culture and interests in washington. when the conflict is so removed from one's life that it doesn't even seem real, tremont said, it's easier to believe ""propaganda on the internet."" what she wants to see more of is initiatives pairing up regular americans with regular ukrainians, such as programs that allow english speakers to teach their language over zoom to people living in a conflict zone. the more such connections people make, the fewer calls senators will receive urging them to cut ukraine loose, or at least that's one of the hopes. ""programs like that are really clever and creative ways to get people to get to know each other,"" she said. ""we live in a world where you're no longer constrained by your neighborhood to make friends. you can make friends all over the world, and we aren't using that — and we need to use it.""",Neutral

""we are providing support to all vehicles that transport this product (limes) in a coordinated manner (with other security forces), with the objective of ensuring that the product reaches its destination without any major incident,” said jose ortega, deputy police chief for michoacan state. the increase in prices, due to extortion by organized crime, also affects tomato, banana, and mango producers, as well as transporters and distributors. extortion and theft cost the country's companies about $6.8 billion (€6.43 billion) each year, the equivalent of 0.67% of mexico's gdp. in other cities across the country, such as chilpancingo, people have faced a massive lack of food products in the past after the murder of farmers and merchants who allegedly refused to pay extortion. “we are drowning,” declare farmers to confront crime, lime producers like hipólito mora founded self-defense groups in 2013 that ended up being accused of being criminal gangs themselves. mora continued to vehemently denounce drug traffickers, until the cartels killed him in june in the community of la ruana, michoacan. ""we are drowning with the cartel that is there,” says his sister guadalupe mora. “they are charging us a fee for everything: the basic basket, soft drinks, beers, chicken. everything is very expensive because of them."" for farmers, there is no solution. the owners of the fields ensure that moving means leaving their workers without a livelihood. prosecutor rodrigo gonzález, head of a unit that pursues crime in michoacan, asks the ""citizens to come forward"" to report but to little success as many fear experiencing the same fate as hipólito mora.",Neutral

""six to 12 inches of rain is what is generally forecast, but there could be pockets of up to 18 inches of rain and we do think that will be the most significant impact that could result in flash and urban flooding and mudslides,” he said. baja california sur gov. victor castro said via the platform x that “because it's moving slowly, greater damages are anticipated.” but little damage was initially reported. some trees and power poles were down, but there were no reports of injuries. police in san jose del cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early saturday. some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. the federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations. by late morning, the area's streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. hotels in los cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about three-quarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. the local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in cabo san lucas and san jose del cabo on friday. airports were closed. san jose del cabo airport director francisco villaseñor said he expected flights to resume by midday sunday. the u.s. national hurricane center said tammy came ashore saturday night with 85 mph (140 kph) winds. the hurricane was moving north-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph) and by late saturday was centered 15 miles (25 kilometers) north-northwest of barbuda. hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of barbuda, anguilla, st. martin and st. barthelmy. the warning was lifted for antigua. the hurricane center said that “heavy rainfall and flooding (are) likely over much of the lesser antilles.” tammy hit two weeks after tropical storm phillippe swept by antigua and barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. the slow-moving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation, where the devastation of hurricane irma in 2017 and philippe's recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. “this means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated,” prime minister gaston browne said in a nationwide broadcast friday. he urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. government offices, banks and most non-retail businesses closed early on friday to allow staff to prepare. residents’ rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout st john’s and near popular shopping centers and supermarkets. local disaster management officials announced plans to open about 40 shelters in communities throughout the country. ___ associated press writer anika kentish in st. john's, antigua, contributed to this report. ___ follow ap’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",Neutral

creating a colossal fracking operator in west texas. including debt, exxon is committing about $64.5 billion to the acquisition, leaving no doubt of the texas energy company's commitment to fossil fuels as energy prices surge. pioneer shareholders will receive 2.32 shares of exxon for each pioneer share they own. “i think fossil fuels, as the world looks to transition and find lower sources of affordable energy with lower emissions, fossil fuels oil and gas are going to continue to play a role over time,” exxon mobil ceo darren woods said during an interview with cnbc. “that may diminish with time. the rate of that is, i think, not very clear at this stage. but it will be around for a long time.” woods explained that exxon and pioneer will be able to use their combined capabilities to drive down emissions and produce lower carbon intensity oil and gas. exxon purchased xto energy in 2009 for approximately $36 billion. in the late 1990s, the merger between exxon and mobil was valued around $80 billion. the deal with pioneer natural vastly expands exxon's presence in the permian basin, a massive oilfield that straddles the border between texas and new mexico. drilling the permian accounted for 18% of all u.s. natural gas production last year, according to the u.s. energy information administration. pioneer's more than 850,000 net acres in the midland basin will be combined with exxon’s 570,000 net acres in the delaware and midland basin, nearly contiguous fields that will allow the combined company to trim costs. woods said in prepared remarks that the combined company will have an estimated permian resource of 16 billion oil equivalent barrels, with 15 to 20 years of remaining inventory. natural gas rigs in operation have declined over 26% in the u.s. since the start of the year, according to government data, largely due to the rising costs for drilling materials and labor over the past two years. “their tier-one acreage is highly contiguous, allowing for greater opportunities to deploy our technologies, delivering operating and capital efficiency as well as significantly increasing production,” woods said of pioneer in a statement. once the deal closes, exxon permian production volume will more than double to 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, based on 2023 volumes. it's expected to climb to about 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2027. woods said that by 2027, about 60% of the combined company's production will come from low-cost, high-growth strategic assets, including the permian, guyana, brazil, and lng, with total production of more than 5 million oil equivalent barrels per day. “the combination of exxonmobil and pioneer creates a diversified energy company with the largest footprint of high-return wells in the permian basin,” pioneer ceo scott sheffield said in a prepared statement. citi's alastair syme wrote that the transaction could provide multiple benefits to exxon. “across the industry, the logic of consolidation in the highly fragmented permian shale remains compelling with significant gains to be achieved from economies of scale by minimizing facilities spend, optimizing drilling and reducing"" general spending, syme wrote. exxon is flush with cash. the company posted unprecedented profits last year of $55.7 billion, breezing past its previous record of $45.22 billion in 2008 when oil prices hit record highs. exxon mobil corp. has been using some of that cash on acquisitions. in july the company announced that it was buying pipeline operator denbury in an all-stock deal valued at $4.9 billion. pioneer natural has been making similar maneuvers. in 2020 the company said it was buying parsley energy in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $4.5 billion. it then purchased doublepoint energy in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $6.4 billion in 2021. the boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which is expected to close in the first half of next year. it still needs approval from pioneer shareholders. shares of exxon fell more than 4% in afternoon trading on wednesday.",Neutral

""ai in general, and generative ai more particularly, is the shiny object that everybody's chasing,"" mohanbir sawhney, associate dean of digital innovation at northwestern university's kellogg school of management, told insider. ""and when clients chase shiny objects, consultants chase clients. so they're not far behind."" it's been not quite a year since the public release of openai's chatgpt made genai the hot new technology. with it camepromises — and pitfalls. to help companies figure out how to use ai, the consulting giants are racing to scoop up companies that specialize in the technology. they're also looking to hire people with the right expertise and to train existing workers. sawhney said many consulting firms are building dedicated ai units to help concentrate talent and generate ideas that play to companies' strengths. deloitte has set up a center to focus on ai, while mckinsey held onto the name quantumblack, a company mckinsey acquired in 2015, to concentrate its ai offerings. consulting firms' push to bulk up on ai comes as many workers are worried thatai bots will snatch their jobs. yet in the world of consulting, firms have indicated they plan to bring on more workers to keep up with their clients' interests in ai. accenture has said it plans to double its ai workforce to about 80,000 people. that will involve hiring workers, acquiring companies, and instructing existing employees. demand for ai skills is high. on linkedin, the number of global english-language job postings that mention artificial intelligence technologies is up 21 times from november 2022, when chatgpt debuted, a linkedin spokesperson said in an email to insider.and yet not all ai hiring at consulting firms will necessarily involve technical skills. the big firms, sawhney said, will need people who are conversant enough in the technology to spell out the business value of ai and convince a fortune 500 ceo to spend perhaps millions on an ai project with a consulting company. ""they need ai rainmakers,"" he said. sawhney said part of what makes the genai explosion different from earlier tech waves like the ecommerce surge that came two decades ago is the breadth and speed of the arrival of ai. that's forcing organizations to scale up at a pace they're not used to, he said. here's a look at some of what some big professional-services companies are doing around ai. kpmg said over the summer it wouldinvest $2 billion into aiover five years as part of an effort with microsoft. steve chase, who runs a new ai and digital innovation group at kpmg us, previously told insider the task he's been assigned is totransform kpmg usthrough the systematic adoption of ai, analytics, and other emerging tech. ""we have the ability to be much faster and much more comprehensive using these tools to put knowledge in the hands of someone who needs it to be able to solve a business problem,"" chase said. one way people will remain essential, he said, is to ensure the information and recommendations ai produces have merit. ey said in september it hadinvested $1.4 billion in ai— on technology it uses with its clients and on tech acquisitions. as part of that 18-month effort, the company said it had created its own large-language model and that it will train all of its 400,000 workers on ai. a spokesperson told insider in mid-september that more than 5,000 ey workers had begun training. ey said it has created a platform that helps clients add ai into their workflows. it includes a chatbot focused on payroll that the company said will answer complex worker questions. there are other functions to help clients in areas like managing data and using predictive analytics, the company said. pwc said in april it would spend $1 billion over three years to boost its ai offerings and help clients incorporate genai. pwc has also said it plans totrain 75,000 workersin the us and mexico on artificial intelligence. ""we want all of our people to be skilled on ai enough that they can have a conversation with the client — whether or not you're an associate or an experienced partner — so that you can identify opportunities for us to be able to go in and support that client and that ai transformation, as well as to be able to support the firm itself,"" shannon schuyler, us chief purpose and inclusion officer at pwc, previously told insider. accenture said in june it plans to invest $3 billion over three years into its data and ai group aimed at helping clients use the technology to boost growth, efficiency, and resilience. accenture said it would double its ai talent to 80,000 workers through a mix of hiring, training, and acquisitions. the company's data and ai group plans to develop services and off-the-shelf models for companies in 19 industries. accenture also introduced a genai tool designed to help clients make decisions around ai. bain & company in february said it had struck a services agreement with chatgpt parent openai. bain said that in the prior year it had added openai technology into its knowledge-management systems, research, and processes in order to increase efficiency. boston consulting group is working with openai as part of a broader effort around ai. in december, bcg said it had created bcg x, a tech build and design division. bcg x includes nearly 3,000 technologists, scientists, programmers, engineers, and ""human-centered designers"" in some 80 cities. the investments in ai at bcg and elsewhere could help an unlikely group: consultants who rank below average. a recentstudy conducted at bcgfound that below-average consultants drew more benefit from ai than did higher-ranked consultants. the study, which involved 758 bcg consultants globally, found that below-average performers who used ai saw their average performance jump by 43% in a test involving a fictional client company compared with a 17% gain for their above-average colleagues. deloitte announced in april it had started a new practice aimed at focusing on generative ai. that same month, deloitte introduced a set of services called quartz ai to help clients use technology like genai. in addition, the company has a genai partnership with the chip giant nvidia. the quartz ai services use nvidia platforms. deloitte said in august it's investing more than $2 billion in global technology training efforts to increase skills in areas including ai. in 2015, mckinsey acquired a company called quantumblack. mckinsey adopted the quantumblack name for its ai offerings. the company has a research center called quantumblack labs, which is focused on ai and machine learning; its goal is to support more than 1,300 data scientists in more than 50 locations. the company in june said it was introducing a series of ai-development tools called quantumblack horizon to help organizations use ai. do you work at a consulting firm or a company that's investing in ai? insider would love to hear from you about how it's going — and about the race to hire ai talent. email our workplace team from a nonwork device atthegrind@insider.comwith your story or to ask for one of our reporter's signal numbers. orcheck out insider's source guidefor tips on sharing information securely.",Neutral

[+] the test against mexico will be used for a few experiments. (photo by markus gilliar - ges sportfoto/getty images) it is very much a mission accomplished for julian nagelsmann after his debut as the head coach of the german national team. despite going down, germany handily beat the united states 3-1 thanks to goals by ilkay gündogan (39’), niclas füllkrug (58’) and jamal musiala (61’). christian pulisic (28’) scored the only goal for the united states. indeed, the feeling following the result has been that germany should probably have won by a bigger margin. but on balance, there is relief that germany has put down the hammer against a team that would firmly rank outside the top 10 in europe. in fact, getting the job done against weaker teams like the us has been one of the biggest criticisms of the late joachim löw era and then under hansi flick. so, with the job done against the us, what can we expect against mexico? ""we're flying to philadelphia and training there,” nagelsmann said. “on monday, we'll have the final training session where we will adjust a few things for mexico. we'll try to take another step and win the game against mexico."" that next step could include some rotation. the german magazine kicker, for example, projected this week that david raum could come in for robin gosens on the left, kai havertz and julian brandt could start instead of florian wirtz and jamal musiala and leon goretzka could replace pascal groß. the backline, in the meantime, could see malick thiaw come in for mats hummels and niklas süle for jonathan tah. up front, one decisive change could be thomas müller for niclas füllkrug. all those changes, however, might change very little about the fact that what germany fans saw against the us is more likely to be the starting xi for the euros than not. especially, füllkrug, musiala, and wirtz have made a big statement of intent. the same can be said for leroy sané, who has been in phenomenal form ever since the 2023/24 season kicked off. the us test further underlined that germany's future belongs to florian wirtz (l.) and jamal musiala ...

(photo by alex grimm/getty images) the most interesting question, in fact, will concern the double-six in midfield. joshua kimmich seems to be the favorite for the role next to new captain gündogan, but it was noted that the midfield seemed more cohesive with brighton star pascal groß. an argument could be made that groß’s nomination to the germany squad has come a few years too late. the brighton midfielder has been one of the most consistent midfielders in the premier league over the last few years. more than one observer has noted that with the 32-year-old on the field, germany has now played a convincing match against france (2-1) and the united states. groß’s emergence, in fact, might renew a debate about kimmich’s role with the team. the bayern midfielder missed the game against france with an injury and had to leave the camp in the us early with sickness. although a key player, his absence was not felt on the field. indeed, nagelsmann might use this opportunity to gently move kimmich not out of the squad but to the right-back position. kimmich won’t be happy with playing right-back, of course, but would be a better option there than either tah or süle. navigating the kimmich situation will be nagelsmann’s biggest test ahead of the euros. a much bigger test than the friendly against mexico in philadelphia. that game will be far more a friendly match than the us game, especially after germany started the nagelsmann era with a flyer. nonetheless, it will be a fascinating matchup as the new germany boss will launch the next stage of his experimentation that will ideally result in putting together a squad that can win euro 2024 on home soil. manuel veth is the host of the bundesliga gegenpressing podcast and the area manager usa at transfermarkt. he has also been published in the guardian, newsweek, howler, pro soccer usa, and several other outlets. follow him on twitter: @manuelveth and on threads: @manuveth",Positive

However, a… [+5387 chars]",Mexico,"head of business development and co-ceo at the nearshore company.   china's remarkable rise as a global manufacturing hub has been fueled by its large population and low labor costs. however, a number of factors are now causing some companies to consider alternative offshore manufacturing destinations. as ceo of a company that specializes in nearshoring, this is something i am paying close attention to. i recall one recent conversation with the ceo of a chinese-based company. he bemoaned the fact that his struggle to recruit workers at their china-based manufacturing facilities had reached a critical inflection point. he first opened a plant in vietnam and now is looking at mexico. why are some companies considering diversifying? the combination of an aging population in china and a shortage of young workers in factories could pose challenges for the manufacturing industry in the long term. as the population ages, there is a limited supply of skilled labor, which means the competition for qualified workers could increase and drive wages higher. this upward pressure on labor costs could impact the manufacturing cost structure. to mitigate these challenges, some companies might be investigating alternative options, such as relocating to southeast asia or nearshoring to neighboring countries such as mexico. this is a reversal of a longstanding trend of offshoring mexican production to china. according to the baker institute, while cost savings were a driving factor in the past, with chinese labor costs previously being lower than mexico's, chinese companies are now investing in mexican production for similar reasons as enterprises from the european union, korea, taiwan and japan did decades ago. the baker institute also noted several challenges related to trade conditions, including penalty duties imposed on chinese imports, the requirement of higher north american content for certain goods like motor vehicles, the application of most-favored-nation duties on chinese goods and supply chain disruptions. what are the pros and cons of nearshoring in mexico? for the reasons mentioned above, mexico might be a compelling option for companies seeking to diversify their offshore manufacturing base. bloomberg reported in june that ""mexico, particularly its northern states, is a favorite destination for companies that aim to position their own operations or link with suppliers closer to the u.s."" 1. proximity to the u.s.: mexico's geographic proximity to the u.s. can provide logistical advantages and shorter supply chains. this proximity can enable companies to respond quickly to market demands and reduce transportation costs. 2. competitive wages: mexico can offer a favorable cost advantage, as wages in mexico are lower than those in china. 3. skilled labor force: while accessing skilled labor is a challenge for companies in mexico, i'm seeing that the pool of skilled workers is growing. 4. favorable trade agreements: mexico has a network of free trade agreements, including the united states-mexico-canada agreement, which provides access to the north american market. these agreements promote trade and facilitate the movement of goods, benefiting manufacturers operating in mexico. 5. improved business environment: i've observed that mexico has made progress in improving its business environment to help foster a more stable investment climate for foreign companies. the government has implemented reforms to protect intellectual property and promote foreign direct investment. of course, entering mexico as a foreign investor does have its challenges that manufacturers must consider as well. for example, i've found that it can be difficult to secure operating and tax authority permits and to work with mexican labor unions. i've also seen that new entrants to mexican manufacturing can find it difficult to compete for supplier capacity against well-established and well-heeled automotive and aerospace original equipment manufacturers. how can you make the transition? if you're thinking of diversifying some of your manufacturing operations to mexico, you can consider working with a local partner who can act as a “river guide” to help mitigate some of the logistics that make the transition slippery. i also recommend that companies do their homework. conducting upfront research can uncover the kinds of surprises that could lead to costly delays and necessitate last-minute fixes. it's also important to obtain detailed information about the regulatory environment; supply chain considerations; a comparison of cost considerations, including labor, utilities and overhead; workforce availability and quality control. i believe understanding these factors is key to making an assessment of the shifting of resources. additionally, i encourage companies to ask the following questions to determine whether nearshoring to mexico is their best option: • how important is it for us to be close to the u.s. market? • what is the volume of goods being transported? • how critical are intellectual property issues? • are the cultural differences aligned with our values? to be best prepared, you must conduct comprehensive research, carefully evaluate suitability and pay attention to cultural and regulatory nuances. by addressing these aspects and learning from common missteps, organizations can navigate this transition successfully and tap into mexico's growing manufacturing capabilities.  forbes business council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. do i qualify?",Neutral

""however, data are meaningless without the political will to implement management measures.” the impact of climate change on whales around the world has grown as a subject of scientific inquiry in recent years. many studies about whales and climate change look only at a single species or a narrower geographic area, said laura ganley, a research scientist with the anderson cabot center for ocean life at the new england aquarium in boston. but the way climate change affects the giant animals is global in nature, so the broader approach is helpful, she said. many scientists have said the vanishing right whale that lives off new england in the summer is made more vulnerable by changes to its food availability caused by warming waters. but climate change also clearly affects less-studied species, ganley said. ""this isn't just impacting north atlantic right whales or bottlenose dolphins. this is impacting most stocks in the united states, and not just the ones in the caribbean sea or the gulf of maine,” said ganley, who was not involved in the study. climate change also could affect the distribution and behavior of marine mammals, the study states. whales such as the right whale, which travels north every year from the waters off georgia and florida, migrate hundreds of miles annually to breed and feed. many also migrate across international boundaries, which could require new kinds of cooperation between countries. that is true of seals with large populations in the u.s. and canada, such as the gray seal, the study says. the federal government has tried numerous methods in recent years to try to protect declining whale species, including implementing new restrictions on commercial fishing and new vessel speed restrictions. whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with large ships, and scientists have said both threats are made more severe by warming waters because ocean changes cause whales to move outside of protected zones. safeguarding whales during the era of climate change will require ocean managers to plan for a future in which whale habitats are potentially less suitable due to the warming waters, said gib brogan, campaign manager with environmental group oceana. “this study provides guidance on how managers could prioritize species that are most vulnerable to climate effects and give these species the attention that they need,” brogan said. “if we are going to preserve biodiversity, including marine mammals, ocean managers need to explicitly account for current and future changes in the ocean as they consider ways to conserve marine life.”",Negative

20:30:48.000000,(WASHINGTON) The Biden administration on Wednesday announced $3.5 billion for 58 projects across the country to strengthen electric grid resilience as extreme weather events such as the deadly Maui a… [+5074 chars],Mexico,"(washington) — the biden administration on wednesday announced $3.5 billion for 58 projects across the country to strengthen electric grid resilience as extreme weather events such as thedeadly mauiand californiawildfirescontinue to strain the nation’s aging transmission systems. energy secretary jennifer granholm said it was the largest federal investment ever in grid infrastructure, supporting projects that will harden electric systems and improve energy reliability and affordability. the federal spending, combined with money promised by private partners, could result in up to $8 billion in investments nationally to upgrade the grid, granholm said. “the grid, as it currently sits, is not is not equipped to handle all the new demand” and withstand natural disasters and extreme weather worsened byclimate change, granholm said at a news conference wednesday. “we need it to be bigger, we need it to be stronger, we need it to be smarter” to bring a range of renewable energy projects online and meet the biden administration’s goal of reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035, she said. projects funded by the federalgrid resilience and innovation partnershipsprogram will increase the flexibility, efficiency and reliability of electric power systems, with a particular focus on spurring solar, wind, and other renewable energy, granholm said. the projects also are aimed at fixing problems that may contribute to wildfires and other disasters and will improve reliability by deploying innovative approaches to electricity transmission, storage and distribution, she and other officials said. projects to be funded include $249 million each for rural areas in georgia and louisiana and $250 million for a native american tribe in oregon. the largest grant, $464 million, will go to improve five transmission projects across seven midwestern states, from iowa to north dakota. the money includes $95 million previously announced for hawaii in the wake of devastating wildfires this summer, and $150 million to pacificorp to upgrade the grid in california, oregon, utah and other states. “our outdated grid has been in need of an update for a long, long time,″ said mitch landrieu, a white house senior adviser who coordinates implementation of the2021 infrastructure lawsigned by president joe biden. the grid “is especially vulnerable to the increasing impacts of the climate crisis,” landrieu added. “older equipment can overload during extreme heat and cold when power is needed most. and it’s more likely to fail when communities are washed out by historic floods and decimated by stronger storms.'' the nation's existing power grids are not built to handle the growing energy demand, a fact that is complicated by the intermittent nature of renewables, since energy isn’t generated when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind isn’t blowing. “as we sadly saw in california, aging electricity infrastructure can cause catastrophic loss of life, property, natural areas and forest fires,” said jonathan foley, executive director of project drawdown, a san francisco-based group that publicizes climate solutions. the projects announced wednesday are “exactly the kind of thing that we should be doing: promoting renewables, better storage and better electrical grids for a better, greener, more

including investments in battery storage, local microgrids, grid reliability and new transmission lines. the project will focus on remote, historically underinvested communities, granholm said,

and develop microgrids to work with local utilities and back up existing assets. entergy new orleans also will enhance the local grid’s resilience to severe weather, including hardening existing transmission lines and distribution systems to reduce outage frequency and duration. cps energy in san antonio will receive $30 million for a resiliency program, and minnesota-based xcel energy will receive $100 million for projects in texas, colorado, new mexico, minnesota and wisconsin to improve wildfire risk mitigation, including thousands of fire-resistant poles, tree clearing and wind strength testing. texas has faced repeated challenges, from sweltering heat this summer to a winter blackout in 2021 that knocked out power to millions of customers for days and resulted in hundreds

""eclipse glasses"" that have specialized solar filters are one way to safely view the eclipse. your everyday sunglasses won't cut it. you can also use an alternative viewing device likea pinhole projectorto see the eclipse without looking right at it. it's also unsafe to look at the sun or the eclipse through an unfiltered camera, binoculars or a telescope. if you want a keepsake, you can take photos of the event, butensure you have a solar filterso you don't damage your camera. and don't forget about your skin.nasa recommendsthat anyone spending hours in direct sunlight viewing the eclipse should wear protective clothing, a hat and sunscreen. don't despair! saturday's eclipse may have passed you by, but another major eclipse is just half a year away. atotal solar eclipsewill occur on april 8, 2024, when the moon will completely cover up the sun, and viewers from maine to texas will be in the path of totality. you may want to mark your calendars for this one. the next total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous u.s. won't occur until aug. 23, 2044.",Neutral

""i had no idea what wyoming was, honestly,"" anastasiia pereverten told insider. ""at first, i didn't have any articulate reaction. i was like, 'okay, whatever.'"" it would be, at the very least, an experience, going from a city of more than 2 million people to a state of fewer than 600,000. then, six weeks after she arrived at the university of wyoming, pereverten, 21, had to come to terms with the fact that she couldn't really leave. in february 2022, when russia launched its full-scale invasion of ukraine, including an assault on the capital aimed at decapitating the government, thousands of kyiv's residents were forced to seek shelter below ground in the subway system. ""i had a ticket from denver to kyiv booked for may,"" she said. instead of flying straight into a war zone, pereverten stuck around in laramie, a town of 30,000 people with no public transit to speak of. it was a cultural shock, but it was also a strategic advantage for ukraine: here, in the heart of maga country — a state too deeply red, or at least too closely aligned with a former president for even a staunch conservativelike rep. liz cheney, was now someone who could rebut, with lived experience, the kind of content oftenfound in conservative media. when the war broke out, pereverten recalled, ""i found myself in a position where i pretty much had to start advocating because i was the only ukrainian student on campus and probably one of the very few ukrainians in the state of wyoming."" that's led her to meet with state lawmakers as well as members of wyoming's congressional delegation, including sen. john barasso, to press the need for more assistance to ukraine. this week, pereverten will be in washington to do more of the same — at a time when even republicans who backed aid to ukraine in the past are starting to say enough is enough. barasso, for example, recently accused president joe biden of ignoring the us-mexico border ""to spend billions on other priorities."" pereverten and hundreds of other ukrainians, ukrainian-americans, and their allies plan to romp through capitol hill as part of a summit hosted by the american coalition for ukraine, an umbrella group that includes organizations such as the ukrainian american bar association, genocide watch, and razom, a nonprofit founded in 2014, the same year that the kremlin illegally seized crimea. ""russia is committing genocide in ukraine: mass killings, mass rapes, kidnapping and deportation of children,"" she said, adding that it won't end unless it is defeated. ""there is definitely a moral obligation to step up for that."" on tuesday, people attending the summit have meetings lined up with dozens of lawmakers, during which they will make the pitch for continued support for ukraine's fight against russian aggression. though planned months in advance, the gathering comes at a particularly fraught time: ukraine's counteroffensive has not been as successful as some had originally hoped, and public attention is frayed, another war between israel and hamas having just begun. in september, acbs news-yougov pollfound that 6 in 10 republican voters oppose providing any more weapons to ukraine and half oppose sending any sort of aid at all. more than half of republicans in the house of representatives also voted against the most recent $300 million aid package approved just before the fall of speaker kevin mccarthy. future support for ukraine — the biden administration requested $6 billion — has been a major sticking point in the effort to replace him. biden this month said he wants future aid to ukraine —some $60 billionin total, largely the cost of replacing weapons and ammunition previously transferred to kyiv — to be part of a package that includes support for israel and its war against the hamas militant group in gaza, a seeming acknowledgment of the difficulties of passing ukraine aid alone. since russia's invasion, the united states has provided ukraine withnearly $44 billionin security assistance, much of it in the form of transferred weapons and ammunition, stocks of which now need to be replenished. anna bereznyak, who originally hails from kyiv, will be coming from texas. her own representative in congress is a republican who's been good on ukraine, she said, but she's well aware that the wing of the party loyal to former president donald trump, which just deposed a speaker of the house, is in the driver's seat. ""it's not a secret that we have different lawmakers with different positions,"" bereznyak said in an interview. wisdom lies in knowing who is persuadable and who is a waste of time, she added. ""you wouldn't start arguing with the person who told you the earth is flat, right?"" bereznyak, in an interview, recounted the shock and horror she felt in february 2022, watching from the suburbs of austin as russia launched its all-out attack on her homeland. ""i was terrified,"" she said, worried for friends and family living under a barrage of missiles and artillery fire. that feeling has given way, in recent months, to some degree of disappointment in american conservatives, she said, who are betraying their party's own foundational principles. as she sees it, ukraine preventing russia from taking any more land in europe is of long-term benefit not just to ukrainians wishing to avoid the horrors of occupation but to americans, an argument she — as someone invested in the futures of both countries — plans on making to anyone who criticizes the aid. ""i'll ask a very straight and direct question: are you saying to people in the united states that their long-term security is not the priority for you right now? because that is how it sounds to me, as a mother who's raising two kids who i hope will be living here,"" she said. ""because if russia is not stopped in ukraine, it'll embolden russia to take even bigger steps, and it'll embolden other adversaries."" that's an argument that more republicans made in the past, before concerns over russian interference abroad, in elections or otherwise, became coded as ""liberal"" during the trump era. ""that's a big puzzle for me because, as far as i know, the republican party was formed and stands on the values of freedom. and opposing helping ukraine to keep their freedom is absolutely [the] opposite,"" she said. ""so that's the big question for me: are those people really republicans?"" not everyone who plans to advocate for ukraine this week is from there. from 2010 to 2012 — in other words, just before russia's first major military intervention in the country — paige barrows taught english in ukraine as a volunteer with the us peace corps. after the full-scale war broke out last year, people began asking her how to help. she ultimatelystarted raising moneyherself to provide supplies to civilians and soldiers alike, collecting some $90,000 to date and delivering aid herself earlier this year in a visit that saw her within sight of the front lines. but individual contributions can only go so far: barrows, who lives in olathe, kansas, wants to make sure lawmakers step up and provide billions. ""it's not a political thing,"" barrows said, or at least it shouldn't be. ""that's what i try to really emphasize too, that what we tend to hear, here in the us, is the political side of things. what we are kind of deaf to at times is the effect on humanity."" ""a lot of people that i speak with, they say, 'i just don't hear anything about it anymore. is it still going on? is it still bad?' and i'm like, 'oh, gosh, yes. it's very bad still, and it's harder now because they've been going through this for so long,"" she added. back in kansas, barrows said she sometimes encounters people sharing disinformation about ukraine. she picks her battles and goes in, respectfully, with lowered expectations. ""is it going to change the way they vote? probably not. is it going to keep them from saying negative things in public about ukraine so that other people can overhear it? maybe."" but the real target is not voters, per se, but the people for whom they vote. in the coming days, when she meets with lawmakers in washington, particularly those on the fence about more funding, barrows said she will focus more on the pragmatic, arguably ""america first"" aspects of supporting ukraine, stressing that this is not a question of being more loyal to one country's needs over another's. ""i love being an american, but you can do both. and as an american, we have promised to give everything to ukraine, everything that it needs to defeat russia and to get russia out of ukraine,"" she said. with the 2024 presidential race just around the corner, and control of congress once more up for grabs, it's an open question whether advocates can sway republicans who have voiced opposition to more aid into supporting a priority of a democratic white house. ""it'll be a busy few days,"" barrows said.",Neutral

self-guided hikes through the red rocks originate. a sandy and uneven, but not strenuous trail of just over a mile takes visitors through outcroppings as deep, rich and blood red ochre as anything found at arches national park in utah. the trail ends in a narrow slot canyon begging to be photographed. taking pictures here is encouraged even though it’s on the pueblo. plan on 45-minutes to an hour for the walk. guided hikes are available by calling walatowa at (505)-494-1965. in the fall, keep an eye out for tarantulas! this is their breeding season, and the furry males may be out on the trail looking for a mate. they won’t bother you, so don’t bother them–they pose no threat to humans. a highlight of the visitor center is a new and expanding schedule of special programs, events, and cultural demonstrations. lucky travelers will hit enchilada day. stay current on the schedule by following walatowa on instagram and facebook. this is the place and it also seems like the time. looking around the visitor center, you can’t help noticing all the young people working there. tribal members in their 20s and 30s, many returning after having lived off the pueblo, bringing fresh energy and ideas with them. they’re learning the language. so are their children. the pueblo of jemez has a head start program for kids exclusively using the towa language and a language immersion program for grade schoolers. the young people are smiling, laughing. they’re navigating how to exist in both the native and white world. that’s not easy, but they want outsiders to visit. to meet them and experience their beautiful culture and history. walatowa reinforces–or maybe introduces–that native people, pueblo people, jemez people are contemporary, that the future is indigenous. pueblo of jemez public schedule of events the pueblo of jemez does open to the general public for special events and celebrations throughout the year. be mindful that during these rare opportunities to visit the pueblo, cell phones are not allowed and will be confiscated if seen. same goes for cameras. cheering and shouting during dances, songs and performances is unwelcome. this isn’t a football game or a concert, it’s cultural heritage. be respectful. new year’s day–matachine dances easter sunday–corn dances memorial day weekend–annual arts and crafts show august 2–st. persingula feast day second

historic site in jemez springs, nm. the tiny village of jemez springs–population 250–sits 10 miles north of the walatowa visitor center on highway 4. this stunning stretch of two-lane blacktop is part of the jemez mountain trail national scenic byway, one of new mexico’s 25 scenic byways. a full day could easily be spent traveling highway 4 from jemez springs with stops at the jemez historic site, soda dam, battleship rock, jemez falls, valles caldera national preserve and bandelier national monument. this route takes you almost directly past los alamos where the atomic bomb was developed and by the time you’re at bandolier, you’re only a 50-minute drive from santa fe. the historic site is less than a mile from the shops and restaurants of jemez springs and open 10 am to 4:00 pm wednesday through sunday, year-round, with a $7 adult general admission. the site features stone remnants of the village of giusewa, built there some 700 years ago, as well as a 17th century catholic mission spanish colonizers used forced jemez labor to construct. the jemez population in what would come to be known as the cañon de san diego was roughly 8,000 prior to european contact in the 1500s. their numbers bottomed out at only a few hundred by 1700. today, there are about 4,000 tribal members, most living on the pueblo. be sure to watch the introductory film voiced in towa by pueblo of jemez member and park ranger marlon magdalena and then descend into the replica kiva. annual highlights at the jemez historic site include the pueblo independence day celebration on the second sunday of august and “light among the ruins”–although magdalena isn’t a fan of the “ruins” description when describing the former village. during this two-night event held the second weekend in december, hundreds of farolitos–paper bags illuminated by candles–line the walking trail through the village. overhead countless stars twinkle down upon the scene. jemez springs is working toward dark sky certification and summer star parties for amateur and serious stargazers are held during the warmer months. the jemez fine art gallery artists’ collective displays paintings, prints, photographs and sculptures from local residents, selling them at near souvenir prices. the gallery could raise prices 50% and still be well under market. especially noteworthy are pueblo of jemez member james a. vigil’s sculptures. jemez springs–as its name implies–does offer hot springs bathing. this takes place either outdoors at jemez hot springs or inside the jemez springs bath house which dates to the late 1800s. little ponderosa winery is worth a visit as is the saturday morning farmers’ market may through october. as with everything else in jemez springs and outlying albuquerque, the busiest time of year coincides with abq’s annual balloon fiesta in early october. avoid visiting the area during this time of year if possible as crowds can be nuts. just before and just after balloon fiesta are perfect with pleasant weather and leaves turning colors. new mexico has a surprisingly outstanding leaf-peeping season, the yellow cottonwoods putting on a particularly spectacular show. where to eat in jemez springs jemez mountain brewhouse pizza and beer. there aren’t many options for dining in jemez springs, but they’re all good, and with fewer than 300 residents, after your second visit to any of them, you’ll be a regular. the breakfast samosa–a fried pastry–with eggs and chiles at hwy 4 café starts the day proper. dave’s burger’s & more is a charming roadside shack for lunch. the pueblo burger is served on a sopapilla–a different varietal of fried bread, this one with hispanic roots. the chili is soupy, bean-y and hot–literally and figuratively. los ojos saloon & restaurant proudly serves “cowpokes, city folks, hikers, bikers, drifters and debutantes.” it earns the “saloon” moniker with old school vibes courtesy a wooden floor, taxidermy and bar fit for bellying up to. cold draft beer, margaritas, and new mexico bar food–nachos, enchiladas, burritos, burgers and frito pie – are served without pretense. jemez mountain brewhouse sits at the apex of the jemez springs culinary landscape. they’ve yet to begin brewing their own, but offer a wide variety of new mexico suds on tap, including a licoricey, sarsaparilla-y root beer. the thin crust pizza–not too thin–comes topped with one of two sauces: signature red or spicy red. signature red comes from co-owner jef bold and his wife mary grace. the grace family ran pizzerias in the 1980's and 1990's. the family gave up the business years ago, but gifted the sauce recipe back to jef and mary for jemez mountain brewhouse. fellow owner david martinez, a born and raised new mexican, wanted new mexico flavors in a sauce, but had to innovate his own as nothing of the type existed. using a red chile recipe he figures to be roughly 200 years old handed down from his grandmother alejandria martinez, brewhouse spicy red stars with her red chile as the base before infusing a tad of signature red sauce to thicken and introduce tomato into the mixture. where to stay in jemez springs casa blanca guest house bedroom in jemez springs, nm. there are no branded hotels in jemez springs. no boutique luxury properties either. experiential travelers can opt for the casa blanca guest house & garden cottage. this beautiful property in the new mexico style, one of the oldest residences in jemez springs, fronts highway 4 and backs up to the jemez river. heating comes from a wood fireplace, gas stove and cache of comforters. “air conditioning” comes from screen doors, the 6,000-foot elevation, and shade of mighty cottonwood trees. entry comes from keys–metal ones. don’t worry, in-room wi-fi is strong, cell service can be another matter. the guest house accommodation features southwestern décor throughout, a full kitchen, and piano. it’s more writer’s retreat than hotel room. the wraparound windows might leave some travelers feeling exposed. the adventurous will find the whole shebang a hoot. casa blanca is across the street from hwy 4 café, next door to jemez hot springs, about 100 yards from los ojos saloon and not much further than that from the bath house and jemez mountain brewing.",Neutral

Not only is th… [+5516 chars]",Mexico,"prickly pear sorbet with mezcal frozen citrus grab your journal (and your fork); here’s a history lesson worth your time. at casa susanna in the catskills, diners enter a world unlike no other. not only is the restaurant a part of camptown, a cozy, adult (hotel) playground, complete with sleek cabins, artfully designed lounge, and festive poolside bar, but patrons learn about the unique history behind the name, and the ancient jaliscan heritage celebrated on each delicious plate. chef efrén hernández has very thoughtfully brought two worlds together. the name for the restaurant pays homage to the casa susanna community in the region during the 1950s and 60s; it was then a refuge for transgender women and cross-dressing men who might otherwise be arrested for being themselves in public. when chef efrén hernández and his team learned about this part of the region’s history, and the community’s importance on kindness and welcoming people with open arms, it resonated, and thus, only felt right to pay homage by breathing new life into the name. chef efrén herndández many americans have a preconceived notion of what “mexican” food should be, so when entering casa susanna, some diners may be surprised by the array of dishes that do not look like what they’d normally order at their local mexican restaurant. squash blossom tetalas, chayote verduras, uni tostada, escabeche to name a few. “it’s nice to mess with that perception,” hernandez says. “even people who are skeptical leave feeling happy they’ve had a new, cool experience. they get to learn about what mexican food can be.” cactus salad, an ode to papa & abeulo. chef hernandez riffs on ancient tradition; he adds an element ... [+] of char or smoke to most of the dishes at casa susanna. here, the cactus is grilled and he adds a smoked queso fresco. hernandez grew up in los angeles. one of the staples on his family table every night would be a cactus salad. it was something his abuelo used to make that his father carried on. although it was a labor intensive endeavor, it was an essential part of their meals. “we used to grow cactus in the backyard,” hernandez remembers. “my mom would clean it and cut it up. and, as she watched her telanovelas, she’d lay out the newspaper in the middle of the living room, and scrape the cactus leaves, then cut them into strips. then my dad would prepare it; often making a pico de gallo with a heavy lime marinade and serve it with masa.” tortillas are also an essential staple and something hernandez has put front and center at casa susanna. he calls it their masa program. with four variations of corn—in color, flavor, and texture—the masa program is the restaurant’s main attraction. chef says it is important that he and his team respect tradition while using their creativity. he says he is seeing more and more fine dining restaurants dig back into ancient methods of cooking and at casa susanna, that is key. no matter how many things are industrialized or commercialized, “it’s not okay to lose this history,” he says. “that’s why every plate here reaches back to the past.” chef hernandez says, that he and his team of eight at casa susanna go through about 140-160 pounds of masa a week. that’s hours upon hours cranking the molino de maiz. sometimes people come in and don’t even know what masa is, hernandez says. that opens an opportunity he regularly welcomes. “i get to teach people not only who i am and where i am from,” he says, “but i get to share what’s important to me. and culturally, it is very important in the world, this is ancient knowledge. it’s our history.” chef hernandez did not always have his hand in food; he actually tried his hand at filmmaking first. he moved from los angeles to new york city to attend film school at nyu’s tisch school of the arts. even though he got pretty far, creating two films, one of which even got to sundance, he soon realized the amount of work, money, and time for the craft did not produce the element of creative satisfaction he thought he’d feel. squash blossom tetela, (heirloom blue corn), frijol bayo, alpine cheese, salsa verde while living in brooklyn, he took a job working in the kitchen at nitehawk cinema in williamsburg, which kickstarted an unexpected love of cooking. he quickly realized, there’s a level of creative satisfaction in cooking, versus filmmaking, that is much more immediate. he soon worked at various city hotspots including faro, where his team earned a michelin star (which closed its doors in march). following this prestigious award, hernandez went on to become the executive chef at west village sister restaurants mimi and babs. as with many of us, however, the pandemic ignited many life changes, and for hernandez, who was starting a family, that meant a move out of the city upstate, in hudson, new york, soon landing in the tavern kitchen at rivertown lodge (where he continues as executive chef), and in march of this year, at the then unnamed camptown hotel restaurant. “i’m so proud of the teams we have. even if it starts with me, we collaborate. they all work so hard, and they do it well,” says hernandez. and, much like the restaurant’s namesake, the casa susanna community of the 1950s and 1960s, the team at the restaurant up in the catskills leads with kindness, acceptance, and respect. “things are forgotten so quickly,” chef says. at casa susanna, they not only honor his family’s ancient jaliscan heritage, but that of the catskills and what it meant to so many who needed to get away. “we wanted to keep that history open and alive.” camptown lobby, connected to casa susanna restaurant, leeds, new york.",Neutral

[+] acapulco, after hurricane otis hit acapulco on october 25, 2023 in acapulco, mexico. otis made landfall through the coast of acapulco around midnight of october 25 as a category 5 storm. president lopez obrador reported that communications were interrupted in the city, power lines were down affecting almost a million people, infrastructure is severely damaged and the roads to the port present important damages.  (photo by luis gutierrez/norte photo/getty images) my mouth dropped when i saw that a potential category 5 hurricane was going to make landfall near acapulco, mexico. it is rare to see a hurricane of such extreme intensity directly impact a city with such a large population, and the outcome unfortunately was as expected. nahel belgherze posted on the platform x, “acapulco, mexico might have just become the first city of over a million inhabitants in the world to experience the eyewall of a category 5 storm.” images of the damage suggest that it will take years for the region to recover. was it a forecast bust and what can we learn? there is no doubt that from an intensity perspective, hurricane otis far exceeded expectations. it exhibited rapid intensification, which is at least a gain of 35 mph of wind speed in less than 24 hours. in fact, otis went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane in half of that time. this pace is what i have called hyper-intensification in recent storms. the models were way off so let’s go ahead and call it a bust. even with such hyper-intensification, national hurricane center forecasters certainly had some perspective that explosive development was possible. let’s review their forecast discussion from tuesday, october 24th. senior hurricane specialist richard pasch wrote, “sea surface temperatures are very warm, around 30 deg c, and the low-to mid-level humidities are fairly high.” he also went on to note that there was only weak to moderate wind shear over the system, which is also a favorable condition for intensification. pasch continued, “steady strengthening seems likely until otis makes landfall within the next day or so. based on the current trends, the official intensity forecast is above most of the model guidance. the ships rapid intensification (ri) indices show a greater than normal probability of ri, so some further upward adjustments to the intensity forecast are possible later today.” i have actually been impressed with how confidently nhc forecasters have been in mentioning rapid intesification. they certainly have plenty of practice in recent years. viirs (visible infrared imaging radiometer suite) sensor on the noaa-20 satellite shows hurricane ... [+] otis at 08:30 universal time (2:30 a.m. in acapulco) on october 24, 2023. after the storm, my former colleague and nasa research meteorologist scott braun said, “conditions were present for rapid intensification, but it is hard to say at this time why the rate and magnitude of intensification were so great.” in the research community, otis will be study for years to come. the models did not capture the level of intensification. brian mcnoldy is a hurricane expert at the university of miami. his post below on the platform x is revealing. hurricane specialist eric blake echoed this thought on the same thread. he wrote, “every operational model missed it before the ri occurred and the ec was the best of the sad bunch, which is saying something because usually it has no intensity skill.” though gains have been made, it has long been known that skill with hurricane track forecasts have outpaced intensity forecasts. i have written on this very topic previously in forbes. hurricane track is governed by larger scale atmospheric processes that can be sufficiently resolved in the models. intensity changes are related to smaller scale features of the ocean heat content, wind shear, and energy exchanges within the eyewall structure. many of these processes are often difficult to resolve in our models. a 2022 noaa report argued, “improving noaa's hurricane intensity forecasts will require closing gaps in ocean and air-sea observations, as these data are key to better understanding the interaction processes that lead to the formation and intensification of storm systems.” speaking of track, the forecasts certainly indicated that acapulco would be dealing with some type of storm albeit a much weaker system. forecasters knew that a tropical storm, at a minimul, would likely impact the region but as weather expert tomer burg remarks, it was certainly unexpected be a category 5. we just do not expect this level of intensity in east pacific hurricanes near the coast of mexico. the damage was extensive but was primarily wind-related. the region is not accustomed to category 5 storms, but this could be a harbinger of things to come. it is also a reminder that infrastructure of the future will have to be adapted to our new hurricane realities. ironically, many people have asked why there was not more storm surge damage. dr. jeff masters explains that the elevation and deep water profile offshore were not conducive for the level of storm surge one might expect from a category 5 storm. ultimately, i think the lesson from otis may be to prepare for the worst if a tropical storm or hurricane is headed your way. the looming challenge of rapid (and hyper) intensification will be with us. resist normaly or recency biases. they do not prepare you for a storm that you have not experienced before.",Neutral

""this is a catastrophe. our sorrow is matched only by the outrage because these babies were used as shields to protect a narcotics operation,"" bronx district attorney darcel clark declared at a news conference thursday, which was attended by the families of the children who were exposed to fentanyl at the day care center. mendez, 36, garcia, 34, and brito, 41, a cousin of garcia and a tenant of mendez's, have all been charged with second-degree murder, criminal possession of a controlled substance, manslaughter, assault and child endangerment. garcia is expected to be arraigned later thursday. during thursday's court hearing, nicholas dominici's mother sat in the courtroom gallery, wailing. ""i understand that justice will be done,"" the boy's father, otoniel feliz, told reporters thursday. ""it will not bring my son back."" feliz's hand shook as he displayed a photograph of his son, and his voice broke with emotion. ""we trusted this day care because everything was going ok,"" feliz said. ""every single day, the lady in charge sent text messages to my wife. we trusted her because she kept us updated. we never imagined this was going to happen. had i known, i wouldn’t have sent him there."" ""we feel betrayed because that person showed us that she was going to be like a mother to our son,” feliz said, referring to owner mendez. clark said her office would be taking aim at day care centers run out of private homes like the one mendez operated. ""this case is the bleakest reminder that we must be relentless in removing drug traffickers from our community,"" clark said. ""we will get justice for them. but what we have to do is make sure this never, ever happens again to any other child."" clark said she is angry, hurt and saddened by the case. ""this was not really a day care center, this was a drug operation. they used babies as a shield,"" clark said. investigators revealed thursday they found an unopened package of narcan in a medicine cabinet at the day care. investigators released a photo of the package after it had fallen into a sink. prosecutors also shared a new image of the drugs in a hidden compartment beneath the floor and a photo of the play mat beneath which there was a trap door that concealed additional narcotics. garcia, who allegedly fled the day care center on the day nicholas died and wasarrested in mexicoafter a weeklong manhunt, is also in custody on state murder charges in the case. all three defendants are also charged in a separate federal case with narcotics possession with intent to distribute resulting in death, and conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death. garcia appeared in federal court on wednesday and was detained on consent. he was not arraigned in federal court and has not entered a plea in either the state or federal cases. a fourth defendant, renny antonio parra paredes, was also arrested in the fentanyl exposure incident and is facing federal charges of conspiracy to distribute narcotics. all four suspects are scheduled to appear in federal court on oct. 12. the suspects are accused of storing a kilo of fentanyl in a closet at the day care center, prosecutors said. six kilos of fentanyl-laced heroin and other controlled substances were found beneath a trap door at the center that was hidden by a padded mat that the children used to nap on, prosecutors said.  mendez called 911 on sept. 15, reporting that the children had fallen ill, according to police. investigators said that before mendez called 911, she phoned her husband. in all, four children were sickened from fentanyl exposure at the day care center, and paramedics used narcan to revive three of them. nicholas could not be resuscitated and died at a hospital. the children who survived range in age from 8 months to 2 years, officials said.  mendez is also accused of deleting more than20,000 text messagesthat she and her husband exchanged between march 2021 and the day nicholas dominici died from fentanyl exposure, authorities said. garcia was captured on surveillance video allegedly fleeing the day care via a back alley and carrying two heavy shopping bags while the children were ill, according to prosecutors. mendez's attorney claimed she was not aware the drugs were stashed at the center. attorneys for the other suspects have not publicly commented on the charges.",Negative

[+] images) mexico's top two political parties selected female presidential nominees, virtually ensuring that the nation's next leader will be a woman. it will be a historic first for the country, which has established itself as a global leader in promoting gender equality in government. mexico’s ruling party selected claudia sheinbaum as its candidate. sheinbaum served as the mayor of mexico city and is a protégé of mexico’s current president, andrés manuel lópez obrador. in the june 2, 2024 election, she will face off against the opposition candidate, engineer and tech entrepreneur xóchitl gálvez. although other candidates will appear on the ballot, the victor is expected to be either sheinbaum or gálvez. the rise of women in political power in mexico can be attributed to years of increasingly stringent quotas for women in government positions. these efforts culminated in a bold 2019 constitutional reform called “gender parity in everything.” this legislation required that political parties put forward equal numbers of male and female candidates for congressional seats, governorships, municipal government positions and even the supreme court. as a result of the legislation, mexico has become a trailblazer in gender equity in politics. “i think they really have positioned themselves as a global leader on this issue,” says jennifer piscopo, a professor of gender and politics at the royal holloway university of london. “in latin america, bolivia and ecuador have similar constitutional and electoral statutes in place that would allow them to do what mexico is doing, but they haven't had the strong implementation that mexico has,” she adds. it all started in 1996 when mexican lawmakers recommended that women make up 30% of all congressional candidates. in 2002, this recommendation became law, and by 2008, the quota was raised to 40% female representation. in 2014, the percentage was increased once more to 50%. the 2019 “gender parity in everything” constitution reform expanded the 50% quota to include the executive, legislative and judicial branches. these quotas have been a game-changer in transforming women’s access to political power in mexico. female congressional representation climbed from 15% in 1994 to 50% in 2023, and many states now have female governors for the first time. the 11-justice supreme court now includes four women and a female chief justice. in total, mexico ranks fourth when it comes to female representation in parliaments throughout the world. by comparison, the united states is not close to achieving gender parity and occupies the 70th position in rankings of female representation in national parliaments. in the u.s., only 25% of senators and 28.8% of representatives are women. unfortunately, implementing a quota like their southern neighbors would be difficult. in the u.s., political candidates select their party without party control, which makes it nearly impossible to restrict political parties’ nominees with quotas. although the u.s. political system makes implementing the quota systems challenging, there are still avenues for getting more women involved in politics. for example, piscopo says that the parties can still recruit more women. “they [parties] play an important role in support, choosing which candidates they're going to finance and choosing which candidates they're going to campaign for,” she says. this process could evolve to cultivate a more diverse set of candidates. in addition, the u.s. federal electoral commission implemented a change allowing candidates to use campaign donations to fund childcare costs that result from time spent running for office. “things like that are huge for women,” piscopo explains. as for the upcoming presidential election in mexico, candidate gálvez believes ovaries are what’s needed to fight the organized crime and drug cartels that contribute to the violence in the country.

ties with the world's second-largest economy but seeks a level playing field so that american companies can compete freely. senate majority leader chuck schumer and five other senators arrived in shanghai earlier in the day on a three-country tour that will also take them to south korea and japan. the trip comes amid a sharp deterioration in relations between the u.s. and china and as officials try to lay the groundwork for a possible meeting between presidentsjoe bidenand xi jinping in november. “we are prepared to compete but we do not seek to conflict,” schumer told shanghai's communist party chief shortly after the delegation's arrival. the party head, chen jining, avoided specific issues in his public remarks, saying that a healthy and stable china-u.s. relationship would benefit the entire world. he noted the presence of 5,640 american companies in shanghai, and said he is happy to have the opportunity to discuss how to promote trade at the local level. the u.s. has placed tariff and other trade restrictions on china over national security, human rights and other concerns and blocked access to advanced semiconductors and other key technologies. china has accused the u.s. of seeking to contain its economic development as it emerges as a global power and potential threat to the u.s.-led international order. schumer said the u.s. wants the chinese people to have increased economic opportunity but that many americans feel china does not treat u.s. companies fairly. “we believe we need reciprocity allowing american companies to compete as freely in china as chinese companies are able to compete here,” he said. a series of high-ranking biden administration officials have met their chinese counterparts in beijing in recent months, but schumer and his colleagues are the first american lawmakers to make the trip since china lifted its covid-19 restrictions in december of last year. the delegation of three democrats and three republicans landed on a u.s. government jet on an overcast and windy afternoon. the republicans were led by idaho sen. mike crapo, the senior member of his party on the senate finance committee. schumer is a new york democrat. china, in a statement earlier this week, said it hoped the visit would “contribute to a more objective understanding of china in the u.s. congress.” schumer also raised the issue of chinese companies that have stopped making fentanyl but which the u.s. government says continue to supply the ingredients for production of the opioid in mexico. “they are fueling the fentanyl crisis that is poisoning communities across the united states,” he said. “every one of us knows families who have lost young men and women to fentanyl.” china has said that it maintains strict control of the chemicals to ensure they are not exported for illegal purposes and that the u.s. should stop shifting the blame for its failure to curb drug abuse. in a reminder of the tensions between the two countries, china's commerce ministry said on saturday that new u.s. restrictions placed on 42 chinese companies were ""a typical act of economic coercion and unilateral bullying.” the u.s. commerce department added the chinese companies and seven others to its entity list on friday. it said the companies supplied “u.s.-origin” semiconductors that russia uses for missile guidance systems and drones in the war against ukraine. american companies cannot export to organizations on the entity list without obtaining a special license. a chinese international relations expert said that schumer's visit is a sign of improvement in china-u.s. relations. the senators hope to meet xi in beijing during their visit. “if the talks proceed well, there is the possibility that president xi will meet schumer,” said wang yiwei, director of the institute of international affairs at renmin university of china. “if their meeting is realized, the chances for a xi-biden meeting will become greater.” the white house has been in touch with schumer and supports the delegation's visit to the region, white house press secretary karine jean-pierre said after the trip was announced.",Neutral

Speaki… [+4434 chars]",Mexico,"in a rare address to the nation from the oval office, president joe biden on thursday night made the case to americans that it's ""vital"" to both global and u.s. national securityto assist ukraine and israel in their respective conflicts, which threaten broader disruptions in europe and the middle east. ""i know the conflicts can seem far away and it's natural to ask: why does this matter to america?"" biden said. ""so let me share with you why making sure israel and ukraine succeed is vital for america's national security. you know, history has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction."" solemn throughout his remarks, the president stressed what he saw as america's role as a defender of democracy and as a ""beacon to the world, still,"" while seeking to reassure the nation amid a time of rising anger, grief and unrest in the wake of hamas' terror attack on israel and israel's resulting war on hamas in the palestinian territory of gaza. ""to all of you hurting, those of you who are hurting, i want you to know: i see you. you belong,"" the president said. ""and i want to say this to you: you're all america."" biden's remarks came one day after his wartime visit to tel aviv, a high-stakes test of his personal diplomacy and u.s. world leadership in a crisis.  in israel, he expressed unwavering support in the wake of hamas' attacks, which killed some 1,400, and secured an agreement from prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his war cabinet to allow humanitarian aid to enter gaza. but he also urged officials to practice restraint as they ramp up operations against hamas in gaza, where thousands have been killed so far in the conflict. biden warned israel not to repeat what he called the ""mistakes"" made by the united states in the aftermath of 9/11 -- a message he echoed from the white house on thursday night. ""i cautioned the government of israel not to be blinded by rage,"" biden said in the oval office, his second speech there. ""and here in america, let us not forget who we are. we reject all forms, all forms of hate, whether against muslims, jews or anyone. that's what great nations do, and we are a great nation."" biden directly addressed the fear in jewish communities of being targeted, and he denounced the killing of wadea al-fayoume, a 6-year-old palestinian american boy, in chicago last week. authorities suspect it was a hate crime. shortly after his speech, biden spoke with the boy's father and uncle, the white house said. ""we can't stand by and stand silent when this happens,"" biden said. ""we must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. we must also, without equivocation, denounce islamophobia.""  biden's speech laid the groundwork for a large foreign aid proposal he will be sending to congress in support of israel and ukraine, he said -- specifically to shore up their defense capabilities. he spoke with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy ahead of his remarks, and zelenskyy thanked him for the ongoing u.s. assistance. in his address, biden took a moment to reflect on his surprise visit to ukraine earlier this year, first arriving in poland and then taking a 10-hour train ride to kyiv, to mark one year since the start of russia's war. biden said he was bringing ""the promise of america to the people who today are fighting for the same things we fought for 250 years ago."" ""hamas and putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy,"" biden said, referring to the extremist group and russia's president, who launched an invasion of ukraine in early 2022. the president's aid proposal, still in flux, could amount to some $100 billion, including a whopping $60 billion more for ukraine, sources familiar with the draft have told abc news.  while biden did not mention a specific number for his forthcoming request to congress, he called it ""a smart investment that’s going to pay dividends for american security for generations, help us keep american troops out of harm's way, help us build a world that is safer and more peaceful and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren."" the white house's draft aid proposal would also include $10 billion for israel, as well as money for the u.s.-mexico border -- likely an appeal to conservatives who've expressed opposition to sending more assistance to ukraine. but the request will fall on a paralyzed congress, with the house without a speaker since the historic ouster of kevin mccarthy more than two weeks ago. republicans have, so far, been unable to come to a consensus on a successor, leaving the chamber in chaos. the terror attacks in israel have prompted some sense of urgency to fill the void. oklahoma rep. tom cole, while nominating ohio's jim jordan for the post, received a standing ovation from republicans and democrats alike when he invoked israel's right to defend itself. but as of thursday, the path forward to handing down the speaker's gavel remained unclear. biden, who is in the early stages of his own reelection bid, said thursday that it was time to get past the divisions at home to ensure order abroad. ""we can't let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of the way of our responsibilities of as a great nation,"" he said. ""we cannot and will not let terrorists like hamas and tyrants like putin win. i refuse to let that happen. in moments like these ... we have to remember who we are. we are the united states of america."" ""we are the essential nation,"" he said. ""american leadership is what holds the world together. american alliances are what keep us, america, safe. american values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. to put all that at risk -- if we walk away from ukraine, if we turn our backs on israel -- it’s just not worth it."" abc news' mary bruce, anne flaherty, ben gittleson, justin gomez and rachel scott contributed to this report.",Neutral

[+] (photo by federico gambarini/picture alliance via getty images) with the 3-1 statement win over the us men’s soccer team out of the way, germany got the required result in the second of two friendlies when they drew mexico 2-2 in philadelphia on tuesday night. antonio rüdiger (25’) and niclas füllkrug (51’) scored for germany, and uriel antuna (37’) and erick sanchez (47’) were the two scorers for mexico. “we knew we could have done a few things better,” new bundestrainer julian nagelsmann said after the game to süddeutsche zeitung. “but i have never trained a more teachable team; i am fascinated.” nagelsmann added that he will stay in contact with the team ahead of the friendlies against turkey and austria. “by then, the team will be significantly improved.” although the us trip must be noted down as a success, there is still significant room for improvement. just like was the case against the united states, germany struggled against mexico whenever they had to switch from attack to defense quickly. rüdiger, in particular, made a lousy clearance attempt ahead of the first mexico goal, and niklas süle had trouble in the quick transition. mexico’s coach, jaime lozano, quickly identified germany’s weaknesses, by having his side stay compact in defense and fast in transition. it almost worked, as his side had the germans on the brink of defeat after sanchez scored an unlikely header to give mexico the lead. füllkrug quickly equalized, however, and with bundesliga games just around the corner, both teams then seemed to basically agree on a non-aggression pact for the rest of the second half. indeed, both lozano and nagelsmann rotated heavily, making five and six substitutions, respectively, which also hurt the flow of the game, and were a reminder that essential league games are just around the corner. german players celebrate füllkrug's equalizer against mexico. (photo by federico gambarini/picture ... [+] alliance via getty images) the timing of the trip, with players flying back just four days of key bundesliga games, was criticized by several coaches and functionaries in germany. but despite the criticism, the us trip must be considered a success. far away from the german media circus, nagelsmann was able to have his squad together for a few days and plant the seed for a new culture among a national team desperate for an identity. with that in mind, it was clear that not everything would be perfect in the first two games of a new era. “the form curve can’t go straight up,” germany captain ilkay gündogan said to ard after the match while underlying that there is now a strong sense of optimism among the players. that optimism is fed by nagelsmann. “i have told the team that i know that we can be successful,” nagelsmann said. the 36-year-old is right to spread optimism. after all, nagelsmann has a history when it comes to turning an impossible scenario into success in just short order. aged just 28, nagelsmann rescued hoffenheim from inevitable relegation in 2015/16 and then turned the bundesliga side into a champions league team within two seasons. at hoffenheim, nagelsmann simply unearthed existing talent but also made hoffenheim play bigger than the sum of its part. playing bigger than the sum of its parts has always been the cornerstone of germany’s success. on this us trip, nagelsmann highlighted that he can not only get players like jamal musiala and leroy sané to play up to their talent but that he could also form a unit of a group of players that have felt far too disjointed since winning the confederations cup in 2017. manuel veth is the host of the bundesliga gegenpressing podcast and the area manager usa at transfermarkt. he has also been published in the guardian, newsweek, howler, pro soccer usa, and several other outlets. follow him on twitter: @manuelveth and on threads: @manuveth",Neutral

The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the… [+33500 chars]","Congo, The Democratic Republic of the"," department of public information . news and media division . new york 25 october 2023 the   following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by   stéphane dujarric, spokesperson for the secretary-general. good afternoon. **press briefings a   couple of briefings i want to flag.  tomorrow, we will have at   12:30 p.m. the secretary-general, here, in a pre-scheduled press   conference, to announce the members of his advisory board on artificial   intelligence.  he will be accompanied by his envoy on technology,   amandeep singh gill. also joining virtually will be officials from the   un human rights office, united nations educational, scientific and   cultural organization (unesco), the international telecommunications   union (itu) and the un university. ahead of that briefing, once i   am done and monica [grayley] is done, there will be a background   briefing by a senior un official on the advisory board's membership and   its objectives.  so, if you are interested, please stay seated.  at   2 p.m., there will be a briefing by mariana katzarova, the special   rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the russian federation.    that will be in this room. **middle east this   morning, i think you all heard, the secretary-general said he was   shocked by misinterpretations by some of his statement yesterday in the   security council — as if it was justifying acts of terror by hamas.    this is false, he said.  it was the opposite.  he noted he had clearly   condemned the acts by hamas unequivocally and had added that, as he   said, ""the grievances of the palestinian people cannot justify the   appalling attacks by hamas"".  the secretary-general said it was   necessary to set the record straight — especially out of respect for the   victims and to their families. **gaza an update on   the situation in gaza:  our humanitarian colleagues are telling us that   the humanitarian crisis has reached an unprecedented point.  the un   relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east (unrwa) —   by far the largest humanitarian provider in gaza — warned that unless,   fuel is allowed into gaza immediately, unrwa will be forced to halt its   operations tonight.  hospitals are shutting down.  they lack fuel,   water, medical supplies and personnel.  fuel is being severely rationed   and is used to run a select number of critical facilities.  the back-up   generators are not designed for continuous operations and could break   down. un personnel yesterday visited hospitals and saw many wounded   people who were unconscious, with open wounds, lying on beds, stretchers   and on the floor, with limited medical assistance. food stocks   are running out.  the world food programme (wfp) estimates that the   current supplies of essential food in gaza are sufficient for about   12 days.  however, at shops, the available stock is expected to last for   only five days.  people are resorting to well water, which is extremely   high in salt and poses immediate health risks.  health partners have   also detected cases of chicken pox, scabies and diarrhoea, due to the   poor sanitation conditions and consumption of water from unsafe   sources.  the number of internally displaced is now estimated at over   1.4 million people, including 590,000 people sheltered in unrwa   designated shelters. **lebanon and, to the north, our   colleagues in the united nations interim force in lebanon (unifil) tell   us that there were again exchanges of fire across the blue line this   morning.  as the unifil head of mission and force commander reiterated   today in a statement, unifil continues to implement its mandate,   including to patrol along the blue line and to engage with the parties   in an attempt to de-escalate existing tensions. **women, peace and security back here, the secretary-generalspokeat thesecurity councilon the topic of women, peace and security. he said that, at a time when   conflicts are raging and tensions are rising, the world needs to take   note and be inspired by the immense contributions of women to global   peace and security.  women's participation should be a default, not an   afterthought, mr. [antónio] guterres said, noting that far too many   women's organizations struggle to fund their essential work, as military   spending soars; and far too many perpetrators of sexual violence walk   free and far too many peace processes exclude women. he urged   countries to ensure that women are in the room for peace talks, to   provide funding for gender equality initiatives and include women at all   levels of political and civil life.  also briefing the council was the   executive director of un-women, sima bahous.  and on the same topic, i   want to encourage you to visit the photo exhibit outside the visitors'   entrance on 46th street, featuring the portraits of women   peacebuilders and peacekeepers.  this was organized by the department of   peace operations, the department of political and peacebuilding   affairs, un-women and the elsie initiative fund.  stop by if you get a   chance.  it is a very interesting exhibit. **deputy secretary-general's travel our   deputy secretary-general, amina mohammed, is in brussels to take part   in the global gateway forum today.  during her visit, she will also meet   with heads of state, eu officials and representatives from the world   bank, european investment bank, and other partners.  at the opening of   the forum, she called for strengthened political leadership, financing   and partnerships to achieve the sustainable development goals (sdgs).    ""we have only seven years to deliver on the promise of the 2030 agenda   and the sdgs.  the time for bold and audacious action has arrived."" **democratic republic of the congo from   the democratic republic of the congo, the office for the coordination   of humanitarian affairs warns that the escalation of violence continues   in north kivu province, in the east of the country. on monday, according   to local sources, a new attack by an armed group in the town of oicha,   in beni territory, killed at least 25 civilians, injured several others   and forced 1,500 people to flee their homes.  humanitarian activities in   the town have been suspended and humanitarian personnel have been   temporarily withdrawn.  the ongoing violence in north kivu has disrupted   the distribution of vital food assistance intended to reach more than   25,000 displaced people and other vulnerable people across the   province.  since early october, the violence has led to the displacement   of almost 200,000 men, women and children, mainly in the territories of   masisi and rutshuru.  and we have been highlighting the ongoing   conflict in this area for some time.  despite the volatile environment,   humanitarian organizations remain committed to scaling up the   humanitarian response.  since 15 october, 140,000 displaced people have   received food assistance in the territory of masisi. **yemen lastly,   turning to developments in yemen, hans grundberg, our special envoy for   yemen, yesterday concluded a visit to london, in the united kingdom,   where he engaged in a series of meetings with lord ahmad of wimbledon,   who is the minister of state for the middle east, north africa, south   asia, and the united nations.  mr. grundberg stressed the pressing need   for a political solution to the yemeni crisis, emphasizing the   importance of the international community and security council member   states working together in a concerted effort to bring yemenis closer to   the peace they aspire to achieve.  the special envoy also attended a   round-table discussion with united kingdom members of parliament.    discussions encompassed the creation of conditions conducive to a   sustainable peace process in yemen.  you were clearly all paying   attention.  okay.  edie, and then dezhi. **questions and answers correspondent:    thank you, steph.  israel's un ambassador just put out a response to   the secretary-general's remarks this morning.  and i just want to quote   the first graph for you.  ""it is a disgrace to the un that the   secretary-general does not retract his words and is not even able to   apologize for what he said yesterday.  he must resign.  the   secretary-general once again distorts and twists reality.  he clearly   said yesterday that the massacre by hamas did not happen in a vacuum.    every person understands very well that the meaning of the words is that   israel has guilt for the actions of hamas or at the very least, it   shows his understanding for the background leading up to the massacre"". spokesman:    that's a long tweet.  i think it will be clear to anybody who listened   to the secretary-general yesterday, and if it wasn't clear to them, then   it should be clear to people after listening to the very brief and   concise statement by the secretary-general this morning, what his   position is.  and that there is no justification for acts of terror,   notably the horrendous and abhorrent acts of terror we saw perpetrated   by hamas on 7 october.  the secretary-general will stand by the words he   delivered yesterday and this morning very clearly.  dezhi? question:    a follow-up on that.  we saw now the un and israel relationship now is   kind of deteriorating.  what would that impact the humanitarian   operation in gaza, as well as your communication with the israeli part? spokesman:    i mean, i think you're jumping… you're extrapolating in a way.  i spoke   to my colleagues in jerusalem this morning.  they continued to have   contacts at all levels with the israeli counterparts, whether in   government, with the military, and those contacts are continuing. question:  so those are in a normal condition, right? spokesman:  well, yeah, that's what i just said.  yeah. question:    okay.  so, but, yesterday, the foreign minister of israel, i think   quite obviously rejected the idea of an immediate humanitarian   ceasefire, which the secretary-general has been urged for quite some   time.  what's the reaction from the secretary-general on that issue? spokesman:    the secretary-general's call remains the same.  and you know, i think   for people who sat through many of the remarks yesterday, there seemed   to be broad agreement from member states of, how should i put it,   different persuasions, calling for humanitarian ceasefire, humanitarian   pause for calling for greater humanitarian access, and that is the   secretary-general's position. question:  one last   question.  yesterday, we heard some quite strong words from the israeli   part, which especially for releasing the hostages.  they urges the un as   well as qatar to, how to say, to influence hamas, to release those   hostages immediately.  do you think that this forceful or strong words   could really help of releasing hostages? spokesman:  i'm   not… don't ask me to analyse or predict the impact of what the words of   others will have.  the secretary-general met with a number of families   of people whose family members have been kidnapped and are being held in   gaza.  he told them that he will continue to work for the immediate and   unconditional release of all hostages.  and frankly, for anybody who   pays attention, he's been saying that right from the beginning. yes,   please.  and wait for the mic… wait for the red light.  press the   button.  there you go. question:  thanks, steph.  so, beyond the statement that the secretary-general gave today, has he met with the israeli ambassador? spokesman:  no. question:  does he plan to meet with anybody from the israeli delegation? spokesman:    i mean, if they want to… he was willing to meet with them yesterday.    the foreign minister and the ambassador chose not to meet with him.  he   met with the families and with a senior representative from the mission,   as well. question:  steph, the second question, why do you   think the secretary-general described this as a misrepresentation,   considering that the israeli ambassador, the israeli foreign minister   was present for his entire six-minute speech? so, they heard what he   said before, what he said after.  and very clearly, they had issue with   that one particular line. spokesman:  well, i mean, people,   you know, people hear, people listen to what i say.  we all listen to   what others have to say.  it doesn't mean… just because you're listening   doesn't mean there's not a risk of misinterpretation.  and that's what   he was addressing. question:  does it seem to you that the   secretary-general is just going to let the… this seemed like a very   fundamental clashing of perspectives, not something that will just go   away.  would the secretary-general go public and say he's not resigning? spokesman:    well, the secretary-general has absolutely no comment on his calls for   his resignation. the secretary-general is focused on a number of things   in relation to the situation in the middle east in parallel, right,   which is getting more humanitarian access in, getting the hostages   released without any condition, ensuring that international human rights   law is respected, that civilians are protected.  he has a lot of work   to do, and that's what he's focused on. question:  [inaudible]? spokesman:  there are ongoing discussions regarding the visas through the normal channels.  please go ahead. correspondent:  thank you.  i appreciate it.  this seemed to be a long-standing issue even before the remarks in the security council. spokesman:  which issue? question:    the un and israel.  benjamin netanyahu hasn't apparently still picked   up the phone since the conflict started 7 october to the   secretary-general's calls.  the ambassador, gilad erdan, had a previous   run-in this summer with the secretary-general over comments he made. can   you… i know it's difficult.  i know it might be asking too much.  can   you give a characterization of pre-guterres comments yesterday, the   relationship between the un and israel?  because it seems like there's   been something bubbling for a while now. spokesman:  well, i   mean, we… listen, we understand it is a tense time.  and there are   tensions… i mean, there are a lot of things going on in the world,   right?  there are a lot of conflicts we're seeing in the world where the   un is involved in one way or another, not as a party to the conflict,   but in trying to help ease the conflict, whether it's in peacekeeping   missions, whether it's in what's going on in israel and palestine,   whether it's what we're seeing in russia and ukraine.  that will — let's   be honest — that will often create tensions between the secretariat and   member states involved.  it's a normal course of the challenging times   that we live in, right?  it does not stop us from engaging with every   member state that we need to engage in.  i mean, as i mentioned, we   continue to engage with the israeli authorities, with the prime   minister's office, with the president's office, at the working level,   just as we do with every member state in which we are involved in on a   number of issues. question:  a follow-up question, if i   can.  in recent years, since the blacklist was released of companies   operating in judea and samaria, israel has quietly either revoked or   refused to renew visas for the office of the [united nations] high   commissioner for human rights (ohchr) staff there, foreign staff   operating out of israel.  with the new threats coming from the   ambassador of exploring possibilities for revoking or not renewing visas   for other employees, how much of a concern is there that operations for   the un will be impacted in that region? spokesman:  well, i   mean, i don't know the details about our colleagues at the human rights   office, but i can tell you whether it's a human rights office, a   humanitarian office or any other office that works for the secretariat,   we hope that every member state will facilitate the travel of un   officials on official business.  margaret besheer? question:    thank you.  could we just go back a second to the fuel?  the idf   [israel defense forces] tweeted a photo of what they say are fuel tanks   with 500,000 litres of fuel in them in gaza.  and they suggested to   unrwa that you can ask hamas if you can have some. your reaction to   that?  and is israel still continuing to block delivery of fuel? spokesman:    well, we've not had any fuel going on un trucks.  what unrwa needs is   fuel for unrwa operations, for unrwa generators, for unrwa health   centres, for unrwa desalination plants to have clean water, so bakeries   can function, so people can eat.  this is fuel for our operations.  this   is not fuel that we then distribute to anybody else. this is fuel for   our own operations that we need critically within the next hours. question:    and then on, yesterday, ocha [office for the coordination of   humanitarian affairs] said or lynn hastings said in her briefing to the   security council that 20 trucks were supposedly going across rafah.  i   think by the end of the day, we'd heard some had gone through.  do you   have any update? spokesman:  yeah.  a number of trucks went in.  i don't have the… i just told… question:  and even today? spokesman:    even i have some limited capacities, and i wasn't able to make the   right calls to get the exact number of trucks.  i understand some went   in last night and we have obviously a lot more waiting to go in. question:  but, do you know if any were planned to go today? spokesman:    yeah.  we will know usually by the end of the day what goes in.  i   mean, there's the plan and then there's a reality.  i'd like to focus on   what actually goes in. question:  okay.  and then just one   more on the issue of the… ap reported earlier that israeli ambassador   erdan told army radio that about the visas that they would stop issuing   them to un personnel.  would that affect mr. [tor] wennesland, for   instance?  would that affect anyone in the gaza strip, because they   live, there most of them? spokesman:  there's no change.  listen, i think i answered… your colleague asked me the same question.  i answered that. correspondent:  but not fully. spokesman:    but, i think on… well, as fully as i could.  oh, maggie.  no.  i'm not   aware of any change in the status of mr. wennesland or any of our   colleagues who are working in jerusalem. question:  no.  but could it affect their status? spokesman:  could, would… question:  and, for instance, the 13,000 unrwa staff in gaza, they're palestinians.  so, technically they don't need a visa? spokesman:  they're palestinians.  they're working at home. question:  but, they don't need a visa to be unrwa staff? spokesman:  well, no, they're palestinians, they live and work in gaza. dennis?  your microphone, please, sir. question:    according to official information, 35 un staff died in central gaza.    do you have any information about responsibility in their deaths? spokesman:  well, most of them died in air strikes.  sorry, stefano and then i'll come up. question:    thank you, stéphane.  it's a follow-up on the reaction on   secretary-general's speech yesterday at the security council.  the   secretary-general met also the french, german, us foreign ministers.    when he met them, did they have something to say about that speech?  did   they have any comment on…? spokesman:  stefano, it's a   very valid question.  you know well i don't speak for the us.  i don't   speak for the brits.  i don't speak for the germans.  and i don't speak… question:  but why you were not there during the conversation? spokesman:  even if i were there, i would not tell you what they said.  okay.  celhia? question:    steph, like a little while ago, the only thing the un was capable to   talk about was the war in ukraine.  now it's the war between israel and   palestine.  meanwhile, a lot of people are dying in sudan and in other   parts of the world.  does that mean that the un is not capable of   dealing with several conflicts at the same time? spokesman:    no.  no.  we continue to have a large humanitarian presence in sudan.    we actually are able to chew gum, walk and run at the same time.  we   have the capacity to do it.  the challenge that we're going to see is on   the funding for humanitarian work.  and as i've said here, many times,   the vast majority of our humanitarian appeals are underfunded.  there is   growing need… there's an increasing need, day by day, for funding of   humanitarian operations.  though that's… we don't print money, right?    but, do we have the capacity organizationally to deal with all of this?    yes, we do and we are. question:  but why don't we talk about what is going on in sudan right now, where so many women…? spokesman:  well, would you like to ask me? correspondent:  yeah.  i want to know. spokesman:    okay.  well, i mean, what i can tell you is that we're continuing to   work in extremely challenging circumstances, that the parties to the   conflict have not stopped fighting and that we're continuing to work to   try to find some end to the conflict.  in the meantime, humanitarian   workers, un and partners, are putting their lives at risk, trying to   assist those who need help. we're also in eastern chad, a country which   faces its own complications and trying to absorb also a large number of   sudanese refugees.  i could brief for two hours, right?  but i'm not   responsible for questions that are asked or not asked.  so, if you want   to ask me about sudan, you ask.monsieur? question:    serhii barbu, tv channel 5, ukraine.  the russians damaged a building   near the khmelnytskyi nuclear plant… power plant and power line.  does   the un realize the danger of this situation?  and let me clarify.  this   is a nuclear power plant in western part of ukraine.  do not confuse it   with occupied by russia's zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. spokesman:    well, thank you for that clarification.  i will… i haven't seen that   particular report.  obviously, as we know, there are a number of very   important and large nuclear power plants in ukraine.  it is vital that   they be kept safe and out of harm's way, but i will check on that   particular report.  caitlin? question:  just to go back to   the israeli reaction to the secretary-general's comments, is he   concerned that israeli displeasure could affect the safety of un   staffers or facilities in gaza or aid moving in and out across the rafah   crossing? spokesman:  even before this latest spat, we're   obviously working in very challenging circumstances and we fully trust   that whatever disagreements there may be verbally will not have an even   more negative impact on the situation.  sir, and then alan, and then   ibtisam.  so, i don't know… if i don't know you, i don't recognize you.    so, tell me who you are. correspondent:  yes.  simon tait from al jazeera. spokesman:  simon, sorry. question:    just back on the martin griffiths and the visa issue.  could you expand   a little bit on how that has affected his travel plans in the region?    is he now going to another country in the region? spokesman:  no.  i mean, i can't say. question:  and i presume he is still hoping to get to israel? spokesman:    yeah.  he's in geneva.  his travels… as you can imagine, the more   humanitarian crises there are, the more demands there are on   mr. griffiths presence in different parts of the world. our dialogue   with the israeli authorities on visas is ongoing.  alan, then ibtisam. question:    thank you, stéphane.  i have a question on ukraine.  russia says that,   despite of the several calls for the list of the victims of bucha, it   still didn't get the list from ukrainian side.  could you confirm if   ukrainian authorities are ready to provide this list immediately? spokesman:  i have nothing new to share with you on that. question:  okay.  i have a short follow-up then.  do you know what are the obstacles? spokesman:  i don't have the knowledge to answer that question. question:    last question.  do you think that the un maybe should send the mission,   un special mission to bucha just to collect data to get this list and   to send it to russia? spokesman:  well, i mean, i think   there's been a number of missions from commissions related to the human   rights council, from the icc [international criminal court], who have   gone there.  ibtisam, and then i'll come back to front, and then i'll go   to dulcie. question:  first quick follow-up on other   topics than israel and palestine.  on the issue of syria and   cross-border.  as you know, i think bab al-ra'ee and bab al-salam is due   to expire soon.  at least regarding the agreement, do you have any   updates whether you are going to get that renewed or not? spokesman:  i will check.  thank you for setting that alarm clock. question:    okay.  and then i asked you i think it was last week about media   reports, including israeli media reports about that there are at least   4,000 palestinians workers from gaza that they're in israel.  that they   are held in some detention centres or in some centres.  and there were   also a lot of reports about human rights violations against them.  do   you have any updates?  is there anyone from the un who visited these   centres?  and they were arrested in the last two weeks. spokesman:  i apologize if we didn't get an answer for you.  i will redouble our ask.  yes, sir? correspondent:  yeah.  thank you, stéphane.  my name is alex baluku.  i'm from uganda.  and i'm a proud dag fellow. spokesman:  and we're happy to have you here. question:    yeah.  thank you. i have two questions.  what is the united nations   current assessment of the presence and activities of the allied   democratic forces (adf) in the democratic republic of congo and uganda,   particularly in light of recent incidents leading to the tragic deaths   of students in kasese and tourists in queen elizabeth national park?    and then the second question, the adf's financing sources and   recruitment networks remain a concern.  how can the united nations work   with regional governments to address the financial and ideological roots   of the adf's operations?  thank you. spokesman:  i mean, i   think we're extremely concerned of the continuing adf activities, both   in the [democratic republic of the congo] and in uganda.  we know the   horrific history and track record of the adf.  it is important that they   be… that member states and the un mission has also been doing this, do   whatever they can to fight against the adf within, obviously, existing   human rights framework.  but, as with other groups like this, it is just   as important to also fight the financing, the illicit financing that   they receive, and we are willing to provide any support requested by   member states in that regard.  dulcie and then amelie. question:    yeah, i wanted to go back to the question about fuel and hamas, since   there are claims that hamas has abundant fuel resources.  so, is the un…   is unrwa or anyone in the un system negotiating directly or indirectly   with hamas to try to get some of this fuel? spokesman:  our focus is on getting our fuel for our operations and not have to depend on anyone else for access to fuel. question:    and on the issue of israel asking or demanding that secretary-general   resign, does he have the support of the united states?  have they   indicated anything in the last 24 hours that they support him? spokesman:    the secretary-general absolutely is not going to comment on the call   from one member states for him to step down.  amelie, then i'll go to   the screen, and then i'll go to round two. correspondent:  thanks, steph.  sorry for being late, and i… spokesman:  it is noted.  noticed. yeah. question:    sorry, if my question have already been asked and answered.  on a   completely different topic about mali, there are rumours that the   peacekeepers have started today to leave the kidal camp, which is way   ahead of schedule, if i'm not mistaken.  so, can you confirm that and   explain a little bit why they decided to leave now?  and what is the   context — if there are the same issues in kidal that with the other   camps that have been to… had to be abandoned in the last few days?    thanks. spokesman:  yeah.  no.  so, kidal, i think there   was some misinformation, to put it mildly, circulating on kidal.  as   we've been saying here, we're in the process of implementing our   withdrawal plan in its needs to be repeated extremely, extremely   challenging security circumstances for our colleagues.  we've closed   down tessalit, we've closed down aguelhok.  kidal will be the next one   to be closed.  and we will announce it when that happens.  i think we've   been very transparent in announcing closure for closure, so it is not   the case.  we obviously have had to… i think we've been, again, giving   you updates even on the weekends about the fast pace of the closure,   which the mission had to depart tessalit and aguelhok in an accelerated   manner, amid a deteriorating security situation that was endangering the   lives of our personnel.  the only mandate that we now have from the   security council resolution is to withdraw, right?  the mission is   continuously adapting in the evolving developments on the ground, and we   reiterate the responsibility of the malian transitional government for   the safety and security of peacekeepers and call on them to extend all   necessary cooperation to facilitate minusma's withdrawal. and i can tell   you we've been in touch all along with the authorities in mali at all   levels, top level, working level, et cetera.  michelle nichols, please. question:    steph, i just wanted to ask you about how the un might assess the state   of the us-led negotiations between the un, israel, and egypt on getting   aid including fuel into gaza? spokesman:  you know, public assessment of very delicate negotiations on very important issues are not particularly helpful. question:    has any progress… we haven't seen any fuel go in, and the trucks   haven't gone beyond, you know, sort of, 20 a day.  so, are you making   any progress? spokesman:  well, i mean, you know, it's hard   to hide failure or progress.  so i think you're seeing it in very real   terms in terms of large vehicles, large vehicles going in or not going   in and fuel going in or not going in.  mr. klein?  joe? question:  yes.  yes.  i'm here.  can you hear me? spokesman:  i can hear you.  i can see you, joe. question:    okay.  i don't know if that's a good thing or bad.  but, anyway, during   the height of the coalitions battle against… actually, war against isis   in syria and iraq which caused an estimated thousands of civilian   lives.  i don't recall the secretary-general specifically and repeatedly   asking for a ceasefire.  he did make general statements about   protecting civilians.  but, unless you could point me to specific   statements he made about a ceasefire.  my question is, if i'm right,   then why is there an apparent double standard in asking israel to not   just for a pause, but for a ceasefire while it is fighting a war for its   survival against terrorists who want to destroy the jewish state? spokesman:    well, i mean, there are… we would obviously… the pause that we're   asking for would entail, obviously, a pause from the israeli, but also   from the groups that have been launching rockets into israel, into   civilian population. i will let journalists such as yourselves and   analysts do the compare and contrast.  i will speak on this issue alone,   and you can go ahead and compare the historical record.  madame? no,   press the button.  yeah.  you have to press the button. question:    i'm sorry.  thank you very much, dear stephane.  i'm camelia   entekhabifard, chief editor of the independent persian.  beside of this   controversy, everyone asked you the question about secretary-general and   the israelis.  i would like to know if secretary-general is still   actively working on the ceasefire and if the ceasefire is tangible and   we can see that in the coming days or coming hours to be granted to the   civilians in gaza. spokesman:  i mean, we're continuing to   work for humanitarian ceasefire.  i mean, once it's achieved, we're not   going to hide it from you.  so, i think everybody will… it'll be playing   for everybody to see, but those discussions are continuing.  stefano,   maggie and alan, then i need to leave. question:  yes.  i   had to go back before on what i asked before because it's important in   this, israel accusing the secretary-general and the secretary-general   say that that's false, that the accusation are false.  again, the   question is, does any country in the security council… we know already   the uk government say… just declared that then that they agreed with   israel.  does any other country in the security council, speaking with   the secretary-general, has complaining about his speech and saying…? spokesman:    i will give you a task, stefano.  call 193 missions.  it is not for me   to speak… 192, maybe.  but it's not for me to speak.  the   secretary-general, i mean, you know, a secretary-general is elected.    he's… as i said, he's not going to start commenting on a call from a one   member state for him to step down.basta.  non posso peu.  sorry. maggie? question:    following up camelia's question, at 3 p.m. today, we're supposed to see   votes in the security council on rival resolutions, again, humanitarian   pause versus humanitarian ceasefire.  does the secretary-general have a   message to the council ahead of this vote? spokesman:  unity.  alan? question:    i have a short follow-up on the visas issue… the israeli visas   issue. have you received any complaints from any un personnel regarding   visas as of now? spokesman:  not that i'm aware of.  and i said, you know, the discussions are ongoing through the normal channels.  monica, all yours.hasta la vista.

they always had time. when we did make the move to europe, things continued in much the same way. spending time with our son was a constant priority. people understand the needs of the family in europe, and it's prioritized. european culture is more centered on family, and life runs at a slower pace. when i started working in europe, i moved into a teaching position. there were days when i took my then three-year-old son to preschool and he refused to let me go. i took him to class for a while and the only reaction was one of adoration and support. when we had our second son, i was able to leave work a month before my due date to focus on getting ready for the further expansion of our family. colleagues frequently called to check up on me, as did my principal. when i was working as a teacher in europe, i noticed that although schools are accustomed to giving maternity leave, they need to also deal with a new hire who they then need to find a job for once the teacher on leave returns. what usually happens is that teacher will be needed in another classroom because someone else will go on leave, but it doesn't always work that way. right now at my former school, the gym teacher is teaching the music class until the music teacher returns from leave because they couldn't find a suitable replacement for one semester only. but if there's a standard of maternity leave throughout the country and company, it makes it much easier to find coverage for those nine or more months. after we made the move to europe, i was able to enjoy a long maternity leave with my two younger sons, and i found even nine months isn't enough time. nine months is a developmental milestone when your child is starting to really get interesting and fun, crawling and trying to talk and getting into everything. the biggest difference with taking maternity leave from my job in europe versus the us was that in europe, i was able to extend my leave and still keep my job secure. after my second son was born in europe, i continued to feel the support and understanding of those surrounding us. when my maternity leave ended and i asked the school to take another year off — this time without pay but with continued job security — they were 100% understanding. i finally returned after 20 months and was warmly welcomed. i only needed to communicate with my principal, and they were willing to accommodate me in order to maintain our good working relationship. this big change has had an even bigger impact on my family and relationship with my spouse and our children. living in a society that has prioritized family — from the earliest moments — has been the best decision i have ever made. we have very open and clear lines of communication. our oldest is now nearly 17, and he still calls me ""mommy"" and comes to me for everything he needs, from a broken heart to difficulties at school and big life decisions as he maps out his future. although we have since returned to the states, it has reshaped our family's narrative and allowed us to savor the joys of parenthood in a way i had once thought impossible in the united states. those irreplaceable moments during my time in europe created an unbreakable bond between me and my sons. my american friends envied the quality time i spent with my little ones during their most formative years. these two vastly different experiences shed light on the different values that these locations place on children and the family unit i think those of us in the us can still do a better job of supporting families — and particularly making maternity leave more accessible.if experienced surprising differences when relocating and would like to share your story, please contactjenna gyimesiat jgyimesi@insider.com.",Positive

leaders are in the southern spanish city of granada for an informal summit focused on the 27-member bloc’s enlargement, disagreements over migration and economic competitiveness. friday’s summit comes a day after leaders of the european political community, a forum of more than 40 countries across the continent, met in the city and pledged their continued support for ukraine in the presence of president volodymyr zelenskyy. the pledge was made as fears grow in ukraine that political turmoil in theunited states could delay or preventfurther aid to the country in its fight against russia’s invasion. a rift between ukraine and poland over ukrainian grain exports has also raised questions over whether the eu’s support to kyiv is waning. but eu leaders reassured zelenskyy that the bloc’s long-term support will continue. in aninvitation lettersent to the eu’s 27 leaders before friday’s summit, eu council president charles michel said the meeting wouldbe “a time to look back and critically assess progress in strengthening our european sovereignty, identifying our achievements as well as areas that still require our political action”. he added that “it is also the time to look forward, identifying the future challenges”. an issue that has been a challenge for the bloc to agree on has been enlargement. eight countries have official eu candidate status: turkey, ukraine, moldova, albania, bosnia and herzegovina, montenegro, north macedonia and serbia. georgia and kosovo are potential candidate countries. “enlargement means that the candidate countries have reforms to implement. they know what they need to do. and on the eu side, we need to get prepared. this is the first time in many years that you have a high-level debate on such a fundamental topic and such fundamental decisions,” michel told reporters in granada on arriving at the summit. today eu leaders will address key issues for the future of our union, including our strategic agenda. my statement ahead of the informal#eucoin granada ↓pic.twitter.com/pgylfsbfhr — charles michel (@charlesmichel)october 6, 2023  michel said new member countries should be welcomed in by 2030. last month, the presidents of serbia, kosovo, bosnia, montenegro, north macedonia and albania also said that enlargement should happen “not later than 2030”. but eu commission president ursula von der leyen has insisted that “accession is merit-based”. she says the progress these countries make in aligning their laws with eu rules and standards should dictate the pace of membership rather than some arbitrary deadline. the bureaucratic pace of aligning with thousands of eu rules can sometimes take well over a half-dozen years. in a document seen by the reuters news agency, the leaders are expected to say in a joint statement at the end of the summit that “the future of our aspiring members and their citizens lies within the european union”. the granada meeting will also steer discussions in the coming months on european commission proposals that could lead to tighter controls of exports and technologies, particularly those that could be put to military use. michel plans to work with eu members to assess by the end of the year whether there are any risks to the bloc’s economic security linked to advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum technology and biotechnology. moreover, southern eu nations are keen to address immigration challenges as refugee arrivals and deaths at sea are increasing. on wednesday, the blocstruck a dealto implement changes to handle irregular immigration during times of high arrivals. the bloc hopes to put those changes into law before the next round of eu elections ushers in an expected shift to the right as support grows across the continent for political parties that have railed against immigration. but on friday poland and hungary expressed outrage at the planned changes. poland’s populist government, facing a general election next week, lashed out at europe’s plans for overhauling the rules on asylum seekers and irregular migrants as a “diktat” from brussels and berlin. “we are not afraid of diktats … from berlin and brussels,” said polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki on arrival for the granada meeting. “the plan is to admit illegal immigrants to countries that don’t want to accept them and to impose draconian penalties… poland strongly rejects this.” hungary’s prime minister viktor orban went even further, describing the proposed legislation, which obliges eu states to take in a share of migrants or pay those who do so, as tantamount to being “legally raped”. “there’s no chance of having any kind of compromise and agreement on migration. politically, it’s impossible … because legally we were – how to say it – we were raped,” he said of the rejection of hungary and poland’s stance.          follow al jazeera english:",Neutral

the phone should be just as resilient. and like the pixel 7, the pixel 8 gets ip68 dust and water resistance, so you can use it at the pool or in the bathtub without any issues. the buttons and ports are in the same location, and you get the usual sim card slot along with the option of using an esim. what i particularly like is the matte texture on the sides, and this makes the pixel 8 a little easier to hold. the pixel 7 has a similar matte coating, but the texture is different on the pixel 8. on that note, google is using a smaller 6.2-inch screen on the pixel 8, and that makes the device ideally suited for one-handed use.   the pixel 8 is noticeably shorter and narrower than its predecessor, and coming in at 187g, it is 10g lighter as well. the zenfone 10 and galaxy s23 are even better for one-handed use, but if you prefer smaller devices, you may want to take a look at what google's offering this year. another change is the screen itself — the pixel 8 now offers 120hz refresh as standard. i always felt that it was an arbitrary limitation by google to limit the pixel 7 to 90hz when the rest of the field offered 120hz panels, and i'm glad to see this remedied on the pixel 8. there isn't ltpo tech here, but you can switch between 60hz and 120hz. google's calling the screen an actua display (i don't get the naming either), and it now goes up to 2000 nits, putting it on par with the best android phones. by contrast, the pixel 7 is able to hit 1400 nits, and while that's more than adequate, the pixel 8 is able to get brighter in short bursts, and that should make it a terrific option while streaming hdr content. google pixel 8 vs google pixel 7: hardware  we're already in the third generation of google's custom tensor hardware, and the pixel 8 gets a slew of upgrades in this area. the tensor g3 features the latest cortex x3, a715, and a510 cores, and this gives it a distinct edge over its predecessor. while the tensor g2 held its own for the most part, it missed out on the latest arm cores, and struggled while playing visually intensive games. the upgrades on offer with the g3 should mitigate those problems, and as for gaming, google is using arm's flagship immortalis-g715s gpu with ten cores, giving the pixel 8 a huge advantage over the mali-g710 that was a mainstay on the pixel 7. i'll share real-world testing notes once i get started with the pixel 8, but google is definitely taking the right direction here. on that subject, ai is a core tenet of google's phone ambitions, and the tensor g3 is touted with 10x gains in ai-related tasks over the tensor g1. google's putting that to good use by rolling out an extensive suite of ai utilities on the pixel 8, including camera features and nifty software additions that are exclusive to the latest generation. one of these features is an audio magic eraser tool that lets you cut out distractions from videos. you can isolate all the audio channels into individual layers, and if there are any traffic or wind noises, just delete those sections. of course, for every bold new ai feature introduced on the device, google needs to make a totally arbitrary decision elsewhere. this time, that involves the wi-fi modem: the pixel 8 gets a wi-fi 7 modem in the u.s. and most other global markets, but in india and other asian countries, the phone defaults to wi-fi 6. as for the battery, you get a marginally larger 4575mah battery on the pixel 8, and combined with the hardware changes, the phone should last a little longer than the pixel 7. charging is unchanged, and you get the same 30w wired charging and 20w wireless. google doesn't bundle a charger in the box, so you'll need to buy one if you want to buy either device. google pixel 8 vs google pixel 7: cameras  as with every new year, google is rolling out a slew of upgrades to the cameras. the pixel 8 has a new 50mp main camera with f/1.68 lens that can take 2x shots at ""optical"" quality — just like the iphone 15 pro. the phone uses a 12mp camera like last year, but it has a wider 125.5 degrees field of view, and you get autofocus. you still don't get a zoom lens on the pixel 8 — that's limited to the pixel 8 pro — and while the sensor resolution is the same as last year, the hardware has changed quite a bit. photo unblur was a major addition last year, and it is present in the pixel 8 series, alongside ultra hdr, magic editor, best take, and a whole lot more. google is heavily relying on ai to make the cameras on the pixel 8 stand out against its predecessor. with the pixel 7 already offering one of the best cameras in its class, it will be interesting to see how the pixel 8 manages to hold up in real-world testing. i'll share images and additional notes shortly, so if you're interested in knowing more about the cameras, check back later. google pixel 8 vs google pixel 7: software  the pixel 8 runs android 14 out of the box, and you get the usual slate of google features that are exclusive to its devices. what's interesting this time is that google is rolling out a lot of ai-backed features that leverage the tensor g3, making them exclusive to the pixel 8 series. most of these revolve around the camera, but there are useful additions scattered throughout the interface. and then there's the software update guarantee. the pixel 8 will get seven years of software updates — including version updates, security updates, and feature drops — and that puts it on another level entirely when seen against other pixels, the best android phones, and the iphone.  the pixel 7, meanwhile, will get three platform updates, and while that's one less than what you get with most major brands today, you get updates ahead of every other phone. google pixel 8 vs google pixel 7: which should you buy?  the pixel 8 starts off at $699, $100 more than the pixel 7. however, just the fact that you get seven years of software updates makes it a highly enticing option, and you get a faster 120hz screen, upgraded hardware with a boatload of ai features, new cameras, and a slightly larger battery. google is also rolling out exciting pre-order bonuses where it's bundling the pixel buds pro with every pixel 8 purchase, so that should offset the increase in price. the pixel 7 continues to be a brilliant phone, and if you can get it on a good deal, you should consider it. but if you want a phone that has all the latest google software features and upgraded cameras, you should get the pixel 8. like i said above, the seven-year update cycle makes it worth the slender premium.    the pixel 8 has tangible upgrades across the board. it has faster hardware, a smoother screen that gets significantly brighter, upgraded cameras, and a larger battery. oh, and it will get more software updates than any other phone.   still going strong the pixel 7 is still a good option to consider, provided you can get it on a deal. you miss out on some of the extras that are available on the pixel 8, and it will only get three platform updates.",Neutral

in the first half of 2023, average household electricity prices including all taxes in the eu rose from €25.3 per 100 kwh to €28.9 per 100 kwh, compared with the same period in 2022.  average natural gas prices also climbed from €8.6 per 100 kwh to €11.9 per 100 kwh in the same period. these are the highest prices recorded by eurostat, the eu’s official statistical office. looking at the percentage changes year-over-year, the electricity prices in the eu increased by 14.5% in the first half of 2023, and gas prices rose by 37.9%. these figures are lower than the second half of 2022, when the percentage changes year-over-year reached their peak. the figures suggest that electricity and gas prices are stabilising in the eu, according to eurostat, even though the final consumer prices with taxes are slightly higher than in the second half of 2022: pre-tax prices on electricity and natural gas are decreasing, yet countries are partly withdrawing their energy price support measures, explaining the increase. in the first half of 2023, electricity prices including taxes for household consumers in the european economic area (eea) ranged from €11.4 per 100 kwh in bulgaria to €47.5 per 100 kwh in the netherlands. the netherlands was followed by belgium (€43.5), romania (€42) and germany (€41.3). electricity prices were higher in nine eu member states than the eu average.  as france has the highest share of nuclear in its electricity mix (68.9% in 2021) in the eu, its electricity prices were significantly below the eu average, with €23.2 per 100 kwh in the first half of 2023. this was not the case for belgium, where the share of nuclear in its electricity production was 50.6%. belgium came in second on the most expensive electricity price list. eu candidate countries had the cheapest electricity when the eu's  candidate countries  are also included, turkey recorded the cheapest electricity prices with €8.4 per 100 kwh. the six countries at the bottom were all eu candidates, with prices fluctuating little between them. the average household gas prices in the first half of 2023 were lowest in hungary (€3.4 per 100 kwh), croatia (€4.1) and slovakia (€5.7), and highest in the netherlands (€24.8), sweden (€21.9), and denmark (€16.6). the eu average was €11.9. gas prices were higher in eight eu member states than the eu average, suggesting households in these countries paid substantially more. gas prices were lowest in turkey (€2.5) when eu candidate countries are included. contrary to electricity prices, the candidates didn't have the cheapest gas prices, as shown by the likes of north macedonia (€10.4) and bosnia and herzegovina (€5.9). in the first half of 2023, the netherlands had the most expensive electricity and gas prices in the eu. electricity and gas prices rose in almost all eu countries household electricity prices increased in 22 eu countries in the first half of 2023 compared with the first half of 2022, according to the eurostat data, and gas prices climbed in 20 out of the 24 eu members. why did dutch electricity prices skyrocket by almost 1000%? the netherlands recorded the largest increase year-over-year in electricity prices by a country mile, at 953%. according to eurostat, this extraordinary rise is related to several factors: not only were tax relief measures from 2022 discontinued in 2023, but at the same time, household electricity taxes doubled.  however, the government is due to incorporate a price cap which will lower prices at all levels quite significantly in 2023. the netherlands was followed by lithuania (88%), romania (77%) and latvia (74%). on the flipside, electricity prices fell in five eu member states, with spain recording a significant decrease of 41%, followed by denmark at 16%. gas prices climbed more than 100% in some countries natural gas prices rose substantially in several countries across europe, climbing more than 100% per cent in latvia, romania and austria. they were followed by the netherlands (100%), turkey (92%) and ireland (73%). eu countries italy, estonia and croatia saw decreases less than 1%. north macedonia, an eu candidate, showed the largest fall overall by 14%. all these changes are based on national currencies. eu energy imports from russia dramatically fell eurostat has recorded a dramatic shift in the amount of energy the eu has imported from russia since it launched its war against ukraine. a huge growth in renewables, as well as gas from norway and the us, has  helped to make up  for the dramatic drop in russian energy. the most striking change can be seen in natural gas.  eu natural gas imports from russia made up almost 50% of the total before the war. this decreased significantly in 2022, down to 12% in october. it remains to be seen whether the  recent outbreak of the israel hamas war  will have a similar, lasting effect on european energy supplies and prices.

Anybody wondering about the hands-on challenge… [+8700 chars]",North Macedonia,"eu research is providing the most far-reaching analysis of efforts to boost wild-cat populations and aiding scavengers that help balance the ecosystem.anybody wondering about the hands-on challenges of wildlife conservation in europe should consider a recent tale. it involves a wild cat, tracking signals and an eye-opening journey.in spring 2023, environmentalists captured an adult male lynx in romania's carpathian mountains and released it in a croatian national park called plitvice lakes. the move was part of an effort to increase the genetic diversity an endangered lynx population in croatia and slovenia.new homesthe lynx, which had a telemetry tracking collar, spent several weeks trying to establish his new territory. he first ventured eastward to the border with bosnia and herzegovina, then traveled more than 100 kilometers to the opposite side of croatia near the border with slovenia and finally—and hesitantly—returned to plitvice to settle there.dr. miha krofel, a wildlife-management expert from slovenia, is seeking to build on such nail-biting successes as head of a research project that received eu funding to improve knowledge about lynxes' behavior after their release. calledlynxonthemove, the project runs for two years through september 2024.""we are trying to understand the most important factors that influence the decision whether the animal would stay in a location of release or move to another area,"" said krofel, who is an assistant professor at the biotechnical faculty of the university of ljubljana.while conservation efforts of this kind have shown growing success over the past two decades, the six-month survival rate of relocated carnivores is still only 66%, according to recentresearch. and just 37% of animals actually show reproductive behavior.in some cases, relocated animals simply move far from the designated area.troubling trendslynxes are among the most endangered species amid widespread warnings that the world is undergoing a sixth mass extinction 65 million years after the fifth one killed off dinosaurs. unlike the five previous die-offs, the current mass extinction is driven primarily byhuman activity.lynxes have excellent eyesight and hearing, making them skilled hunters.yet, as a result of extensive hunting, inbreeding, habitat loss and lack of prey, lynx populations in some parts of europe vanished at the start of the 20th century. in croatia and slovenia, for example, until recently only between 100 and 150 animals remained.although conservation efforts since the 1970s have helped reverse the overall trend, lynx populations in some countries and regions in europe are still shrinking.""generally, numbers are slowly increasing,"" said krofel. ""but in some places populations are still declining—for example in austria, north macedonia or in mountain areas in france.""he has teamed up with a spanish ecologist named dr. mariano rodríguez recio from rey juan carlos university in spain.they're focusing on data from existing reintroduction programs for the iberian lynx in spain and eurasian lynx in croatia and slovenia. using that information, the two researchers will analyze a variety of factors related to released animals' behavior.release methodsthese medium-sized wild cats, notoriously difficult to spot in nature because of their speed, camouflage and tendency to be active mainly at night, are easier to reintroduce than some other carnivores like wolves or bears.still, success depends on tricky questions such as the method of release. an animal can be let go directly from the transport box or first placed in an ""introductory"" enclosure.environmental factors like forest cover, elevation and topography can also influence the animal's movements and determine the success of the whole operation.in addition, the lynxonthemove team will assess the impact of human infrastructure. highways, for example, are major barriers for animals, whereas gravel roads are frequented by lynxes to scout out information and communicate with one another.""they use gravel roads as a sort of information channel, almost like their facebook,"" said krofel.turf battlesintraspecies interactions may play a further crucial role, according to scientists.a male lynx, for example, could abandon an area where another male has already established territory and a female lynx might do the same if she senses an earlier female arrival.the researchers will focus on the presence of other animals in a targeted area, adding to information that has been relatively scarce to date.the team's main data sources are cameras with infrared sensors and telemetry collars attached to every released animal and to a number of other lynxes.with the help of recio's expertise, the project is using cutting-edge analysis and simulations of the movements of animals to predict their behavior in a particular area depending on environmental factors.the researchers expect the result to be the most comprehensive analysis ever conducted of lynx relocation efforts.""our results should give a better idea to conservation project managers to make a crucial decision: which are the best locations to release the animals and how to do it?"" said krofel.endangered birdsvultures are another species having a rough time as biodiversity declines.dr. sara asu schroer, a postdoctoral research fellow at the university of oslo in norway, leads an eu-funded research project studying these scavengers from a social-sciences perspective.schroer is tackling the issue from the viewpoint of environmental anthropology, investigating how wildlife management occurs within historical and cultural contexts.called living with vultures in the sixth extinction, orlive, the four-year initiative began in august 2020.schroer has been visiting different areas in spain, which, along with france, is home to more than 90% of europe's vultures. these include griffon vultures, bearded vultures, cinerous vultures and egyptian vultures.balancing forcesthese birds, which have up to three-meter-long wingspans, play a crucial role in ecosystems as scavengers that break down carcasses. in doing so, vultures contribute to the recycling of nutrients and may even contain the spread of diseases.but by the end of the 19th century, human influences including poisoning of carcasses by farmers or hunters in europe had brought most vulture species to the verge of extinction. the decline continued through the 20th century with limited success in conservation efforts.schroer is interviewing a range of people who are involved in vulture conservation—from biologists and ecologists to breeders and farmers. she wants to uncover the motivations behind these efforts.""what interests me particularly is how vultures' way of life relates to humans andagricultural practices,"" said schroer.in india, for example, vulture populations plummeted in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a result of extensive use of a veterinary drug called diclofenac. while serving as an anti-inflammatory medicine in cattle, it proved to be deadly for vultures that fed on the bovine carcasses.in europe, vultures were often killed by humans who regarded the birds as competitors in hunting or simply as vermin.new threatsalthoughconservation effortshave helped vulture populations in europe, they're now facing new threats including veterinary drugs in carcasses, power lines and wind farms.coexistence among humans, livestock and vultures can easily be disturbed by growing industrialization and even government policies.for example in the 1990s, when britain faced a major outbreak of ""mad cow"" disease and was in the eu, a law forbade the practice of leaving livestock carcasses out in nature. griffon vultures, heavily dependent on the carcasses for food, suddenly began to starve.""it's an interesting case where you can really see how public health policies can affect conservation,"" said schroer.a goal of her project is to understand how different regulations and management practices can have adverse effects on animals.""what social and cultural analysis brings to the table, which natural-science analysis is lacking, is to look at the broader social and cultural context—including historical practices and lessons—and observe vulture conservation in light of all these developments,"" said schroer.",Neutral

""nearly all ukrainians firmly share this belief - no more than one in 10 think it will never happen."" ""after 18 months of war with russia, ukraine’s pivot to the west seems complete, while the deep cultural, economic and political ties that existed between ukraine and russia are increasingly becoming part of ukraine’s past"", they added. russia and china, meanwhile, have been left with few admirers in ukraine.  less than half of 1% of ukrainians surveyed by gallup approve of russia’s leadership as its war with ukraine grinds on.  approval of china’s leadership has dropped to a new low of 8%, ""likely reflecting ukrainians’ displeasure with the country’s refusal to stop buying energy from russia,"" said the us analytics firm.

""it is time to overcome conflicts that have continued for far too long,"" german chancellor olaf scholz told the summit. ""the recent escalation of the situation in north kosovo has proven just how important that is"". on the eve of the event, european commission president ursula von der leyen urged belgrade and pristina to return to a brussels-sponsored dialogue on normalisation of ties. ""this is the way towards a future where kosovo and serbia will be part of the european union,"" she said in tirana on sunday. but serbian president aleksandar vucic will not attend this year's edition of the annual summit. he travelled instead to beijing for the belt and road forum, where he is due to sign a free trade agreement with china. serbia's prime minister ana brnabic, however is present in tirana. on the agenda at the meeting are discussions around a greater convergence with the european union and ""supporting ecological and digital transition"" in the region. during the one-day meeting, leaders are also expected to ratify an agreement on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, and announce the opening of a college of europe campus in tirana. monday's meeting is the 9th summit of the berlin process, launched in 2014 by then-german chancellor angela merkel. the berlin process aims to promote political dialogue, cooperation and reconciliation between six west balkan countries -- albania, bosnia-hercegovina, kosovo, north macedonia, montenegro and serbia. it is also a space to foster closer ties with the eu -- with nine member states including france and germany involved in the annual summit. hungary, the netherlands, romania and spain are also joining this year, at the invitation of albanian prime minister edi rama. last year's meeting produced several agreements on free movement and residence in the region, as well as the recognition of university and certain professional qualifications. von  der leyen also announced a one-billion-euro ($1.1 billion) energy support plan. ""the berlin process in the past decade has produced a lot of agreements, but little follow up,"" said florian bieber from the balkans in europe policy advisory group (biepag). ""in vienna, in 2015, the foreign ministers of all six countries signed a declaration to not have bilateral disputes stand in the way of the eu path,"" he added. but despite pledging to resolve their disagreements, the countries have put no monitoring mechanism in place, said bieber, meaning that their disputes ""continue to bedevil the region."" in the aftermath of recent tensions, kosovo's government displayed a large arsenal of weapons and equipment and accused the government in belgrade of backing serb gunmen in clashes in the volatile north. ""we've got plenty to do,"" said an advisor to french president emmanuel macron, ""with concerns about both serbia and kosovo, as well as bosnia"". macron is due to arrive on monday evening and will stay in albania on tuesday for bilateral meetings. ""in terms of kosovo and serbia, we can see that vucic's absence is a clear sign of the lack of good will,"" which could risk isolating belgrade internationally, said political researcher katarina radic.

targets, including us lawmakers, united nations officials and cnn journalists,amnesty international saidmonday. the powerful hacking tool – designed to siphon off call and text data from phones – was aimed at social media accounts affiliated with democratic sens. gary peters and chris murphy, and republican congressman and house foreign affairs chairman michael mccaul, according to amnesty investigators. multiple cnn journalists who cover east asian affairs were also targeted. a cnn spokesperson declined to comment. the researchers said they were unaware of any successful infections using the spyware. but the attempt to compromise powerful lawmakers simply by tweeting at them will raise further concerns on capitol hill about the proliferation of commercial spyware. an obscure account on x, the platform formerly known as twitter, blasted out spyware-laced links to targets of the hackers from february to june, according to amnesty. the targets held potentially useful insights on us policy toward vietnam. spyware operators normally operate in the shadows, but in this case the hackers had no qualms about trying to use a public platform to entice their targets. “it was quite a brazen and somewhat reckless way to try target people with some quite sophisticated spyware,” donncha ó cearbhaill, head of amnesty international’s security lab, told cnn. the european investigative collaborations (eic), a network of over a dozen news outlets, and the washington postfirst reportedon amnesty’s findings. ó cearbhaill told cnn he and his investigators are “very confident” in the links between the hackers and vietnam, citing contract records reviewed by the eic between the vietnamese government and a company affiliated with the spyware. researchers with google’s threat analysis group, which tracks state-backed hackers, told cnn the twitter account spreading the spyware appears to be based in vietnam. mccaul doesn’t manage his social media accounts and there was therefore not exposed to the link, said leslie shedd, a mccaul spokesperson. office staffers were not affected, either, shedd said. an aide to murphy told cnn: “to the best of our knowledge, no one in our office clicked the link.” the malicious link was sent in a reply-all on x to peters’ campaign account. “although the original post tagged senator peters, it was not posted by our office and our office was not targeted or compromised by the malicious link in the reply post,” a spokesperson for peters’ office told cnn. “senator peters and our staff follow all senate-approved best practices to protect their accounts, including regular cybersecurity training.” the vietnamese embassy in washington, dc, not immediately respond to a request for comment. for years, cybersecurity researchers and human rights activists have documented the proliferation of spyware designed to break into mobile phones and steal their contents. but the issue gained greater traction in washington this year following the revelation that about a dozen state department employees serving in africa were reportedly hacked with spyware developed by israeli firm nso group. president joe biden responded with an executive order in march banning us government agencies from using spyware that is deemed a threat to us national security or are implicated in human rights abuses. in this case, amnesty said the developer of the spyware was cytrox, a north macedonia-based firm that is owned by intellexa, an umbrella of europe-based companies. the us commerce department added cytrox and intellexa its “entities list” in july, which prevents us companies from doing business with them without special approval. cnn could not reach intellexa or cytrox for comment. “clearly these tools are being exported from the eu to states with terrible human rights records,” ó cearbhaill, of amnesty international, told cnn. “then not only are they turned against journalists and human rights defenders, but also against politicians and institutions who should be meaningfully regulating these exports.” john scott-railton, a senior researcher with the university of toronto’s citizen lab, which also studied the intellexa spyware, said the findings validate the commerce department’s regulation of the firm. “meanwhile, if european lawmakers won’t bring consequences to reckless vendors, they need to get comfortable with being targeted,” scott-railton told cnn. this story has been updated with additional comment.",Negative
