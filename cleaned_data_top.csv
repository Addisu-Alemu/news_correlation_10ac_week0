""the high temperatures are due to direct heat energy from the sun which is apparently overhead malawi,"" mr kachiwanda said.  the elderly, children and those with pre-existing health conditions are at risk of suffering serious health risks if exposed to extreme heat for a long period.    ""heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heatstroke are a significant concern,"" the weather bureau said.  locals are advised to drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if they do not feel thirsty.  they are also urged to wear light clothing, avoid intensive physical activities and use sunscreen to protect their skin from harmful sunlight.  however, the high temperatures are essential to attract weather systems that generate the first rains in the country, the chief meteorologist said.  malawi is still recovering from a devastating tropical storm in march that killed more than 500 people.  tropical storm freddy saw mudslides sweep through neighbourhoods and bury people in mud.  the storm also struck neighbouring mozambique and madagascar earlier that month, destroying scores of homes and triggering widespread floods. a study by world weather attribution group showed that global warming has exacerbated extreme weather in southern africa.",Neutral

louis, mauritius– until early 2022, gaetan (real name withheld) was earning a decent living as a construction worker, helping on sites around mauritius, when he made a snap decision that would turn his life upside down. while smoking a cigarette with colleagues during his lunch break one day, the 35-year-old was offered the opportunity to buy some heroin. within weeks, he was taking it daily to stave off the aches and pains of withdrawal. “that one decision cost me dearly,” he tells al jazeera. soon he was dipping into his hard-earned savings to find the 2,000 mauritian rupees ($45) he needed for his four daily doses. his fellow addicts at work would strip copper wires or lift corrugated iron and white goods off the streets, selling the metal to fund their habit  – a common practice in the city. in the grip of addiction for a few months, gaetan realised he had to get out fast. but after two weeks of quitting drug use, he relapsed. eventually, he found his way to the idrice goomany treatment centre, located in the heart of port louis, where he completed an intensive six-month detox programme. he still visits weekly for counseling and is a rare success story on this tiny island of 1.3 million people being ravaged by a drug epidemic of unprecedented proportions. heroin addiction, which peaked in the ‘90s, has made a roaring comeback in the country, the drug rerouted to its shores through madagascar on its journey from afghanistan to east and southern africa. in parallel, synthetics have taken hold – drugs like “black mamba”, “rambo” and “murder” made with chemicals from china, which are mixed with thinner or pesticides and sprayed onto tea, tobacco or herbs, providing highly toxic hits to youngsters. “the advantage of synthetics is that they are cheap,” says imran dhanoo, director of the centre. schoolkids club together to buy a hit for 100 mauritian rupees ($2), he says. “today, drugs are the country’s number one problem,” says mario ah-sian, director of the centre d’accueil de terre rouge, another treatment centre located a few kilometres from port louis. the 63-year-old quit heroin 23 years ago and has since devoted his life to helping others free themselves from the affliction. drugs have wreaked havoc all over the island, sparking a wave of robberies and assaults, he says. according to a 2021 official survey, around 55,000 people between the ages of 18 and 59 (7.4 percent of that tranche of the population) consume non-injectable drugs, including cannabis, synthetics and heroin ingested by sniffing, snorting or smoking. calculations were based on small samples rather than boots-on-the-ground fieldwork, says ah-sian. like many others al jazeera spoke to, he believes the real figures are much higher. in karo kalyptus, the impact of the fast-growing drugs trade is easy to see. this is the epicentre of the island’s narco scene, an area targeted last july in a meticulously-planned police raid that hauled 77 million mauritian rupees (more than $1.7m) worth of cannabis, synthetics and heroin. looking around the tiny enclave, a ramshackle cluster of raw concrete and rusting corrugated iron shacks deep within the impoverished suburb of roche bois, it’s hard to believe such large sums transit through here. al jazeera met three local women in karo kalyptus. they spoke using pseudonyms while stressing that they were sick of seeing their young being destroyed by drugs. life here is tough, says marie, who washes clothes for a living and notes that many kids don’t go to school, some starting on drugs as early as age 10. “ena zanfan inn fini andan,” she says, in creole – “there are kids whose insides are destroyed”. earlier this year, she stumbled upon a dead man on the street, whom she believes overdosed on heroin. claudine, another one of the women, says crystal meth and a new product called “ladrog zombi” (“zombie drug”), which renders users comatose, are becoming more prevalent on the market. the name of the latter drug and the description of its effects appear to tally with recent reports of animal tranquilliser xylazine arriving in neighbouring reunion. locals here are employed as lookouts. they earn 1,500-2,000 rupees ($34-45) per day, a relatively lucrative pay packet in a country where many struggle on a minimum wage of 15,000 rupees ($340) a month in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis.  often, lookouts receive advance notice of police visits, sometimes as long as two hours. “someone on the inside is giving them the information,” says claudine. in 2018, a state-appointed commission of inquiry found clear evidence of mafia influence over a variety of actors, including police, prison guards, lawyers, customs officials and politicians. it advised that the country’s anti drug and smuggling unit (adsu), judged too rotten to reform, be dismantled. five years later, adsu lives on, its influence bolstered by the creation of a complementary force called the special striking team (sst) made up of former officers from adsu ranks. as next year’s election slides into view, the government of prime minister pravind jugnauth has stepped up its war on drugs with sombre billboards announcing “unis contre la drogue – united against drugs”. but, critics claim the sst is a political tool of jugnauth’s militant socialist movement (msm), calling his sincerity into question. officers have arrested high-profile targets, including lawyer akil bissessur and activist bruneau laurette,known for advocacy against police brutality and narco influence,on provisional charges of drug trafficking or fraud. the government also stands accused of protecting the island’s biggest trafficker. jean-hubert célerine, aka franklin, was sentenced to seven years in prison for inter-island trafficking by authorities in neighbouring reunion in 2021. yet he remains in mauritius, where he is currently being investigated for money laundering. so low is public trust in the government that many suspect the probe was set up to delay the kingpin’s extradition. “if he talks, a lot of senior heads will roll,” says ally lazer, a veteran social worker, who has waged a decades-long campaign against drugs on the island. “there’s no political will to fight the drugs mafia,” says nando bodha, former secretary-general of the ruling msm, who left the party after witnessing its lurch towards autocracy close up. now with linion moris, a multi-party alliance, he wants to overhaul a system he believes is corruption-ridden. “more and more, we’re turning into a narco economy,” he says. “drug money is involved in horse racing, betting, casinos and retail businesses. kingpins have infiltrated the judicial and legal systems”. al jazeera contacted the government information service for an interview, but got no response.      as drugs become more enmeshed in the fabric of daily life, the country is reviewing its treatment of addicts, moving away from the repressive policies of old. right now, the government is setting up a panel to shepherd users through the various stages of recovery – from rehabilitation to reintegration. it’s a move welcomed by dhanoo who wants to see more addicts in treatment centres, rather than in prison. but, until narco influence is tackled, the problem won’t be going away any time soon. gaetan recalls how easy it was to dodge adsu officers in baie du tombeau when he was out buying doses of “brown”, as heroin is known locally. “there were about four of five dealers in the area. everyone knew where the police was,” he says. slowly, he is recovering. in his village of flacq, where “most people are on something, young, old, men, women”, he has cut off contact with former associates and only leaves his home to go to work or buy food, always ensuring he only carries a strict minimum of cash. “i feel like before i started taking it, but i know i’ve changed,” gaetan says. “it’s a curse. it finishes you off.”          follow al

""how do we build trust? we build trust through dialogues such as the gmc, joint exercises, industrial collaboration, sharing of resources, respecting international law etc,"" singh said, adding that the trust amongst cooperating countries will lead to optimal outcomes in common maritime priorities.  ""since our countries interact with each other on a multitude of issues. it is possible to build trust by discussion and consultation with each other,"" the defence minister said.  quoting the sanskrit adage 'sanghe shakti kaliyuge', singh said in the present era, strength lies in collaboration and cooperation, and cooperative equilibrium can also be achieved in international relations.  ""in our context, common maritime priorities such as tackling climate change, controlling piracy, terrorism, drug trafficking and overfishing at the high seas need to be addressed by all of us cooperatively.  ""if the threats that we face are supranational in scope and impact, international efforts to address them will indeed have limited effects,"" the defence minister said, adding that regional challenges can be managed through multinational collaborative mitigation frameworks.  illegal, unreported and unregulated (iuu) fishing is a challenge related to over-exploitation of resources in the region, singh said.  iuu fishing  threatens the ecosystem, economic security and regional and global food security, he said, adding that it is a common maritime priority to control iuu fishing.  multinational collaboration efforts for the compilation, coalition and sharing of surveillance data was the need of the hour, he said.  ""it will help in identifying actors with irregular or threatening behaviour, which needs to be countered resolutely,"" singh added.  he further said that the ""pandemic of climate irresponsibility"" will threaten societies, and just like the recent pandemic ( covid-19 ), there is a vaccine available (for the climate pandemic).  ""it is a vaccine of collaboration, climate responsibility and climate justice. if all countries accept the responsibility to cut the emission by investing in green economy and shared technology, there is no reason why humanity cannot overcome this problem as well,"" singh said.  our narrow immediate interests tempt us to flout or disrespect the international laws, but doing so will lead to the breakdown of civilised maritime intercourse, he said.

population of half a million people scattered across more than 1,000 islands. but last weekend, the picturesque archipelago delivered an electoral verdict that has sent shock waves around the world — and especially across the indian ocean region. mohamed muizzu, the opposition candidate, emerged victorious in the presidential run-off on saturday andsecured54 percent of the vote, results released by the electoral commission showed. muizzu, who backs closer ties between the maldives and china, defeated the incumbent president ibrahim mohamed solih, who is widely perceived as pro-india. “with today’s result, we have got the opportunity to build the country’s future,” muizzu said in a statement after his victory. “the strength to ensure the freedom of maldives.” the vote transformed into a de facto referendum over the country’s ties with india and china. india has 75 military personnel stationed in the maldives. new delhi says they are there to maintain and operate two helicopters and an aircraft it donated to the country. throughout his election campaign, muizzu pledged to remove those troops from the maldives. “seen from the zero-sum lens that often drives great power competition, beijing is a big winner from this election,” michael kugelman, south asia director at the wilson center, a washington-based think-tank, told al jazeera. “muizzu’s campaign plank was not only about strengthening ties with beijing, it was also about aiming to undermine india by calling for an end to any indian military presence in maldives. this is music to the ears of beijing,” he added. to be sure, india will look to retain as much of its influence in the maldives as it can, say analysts. following the announcement of muizzu’s victory, indian prime minister narendra modi sent his congratulations to the president-elect. “india remains committed to strengthening the time-tested india-maldives bilateral relationship and enhancing our overall cooperation in the indian ocean region,” modi said on x, formerly known as twitter.      new delhi has enjoyed cosy ties with male under president solih, who took office following a landslide victory in 2018 against muizzu’s mentor, former president abdulla yameen. india poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the tourist hot spot. new delhi also financed infrastructure projects, both big and small, in the country. “india will support the new democratically elected government and will seek to work closely with it,” shantanu roy-chaudhury, author of the china factor: beijing’s expanding engagement in sri lanka, maldives, bangladesh, and myanmar, told al jazeera. the modi government, he said, is “likely to continue its pursuit of the greater male connectivity projects” — a 6.7km (4-mile) road project currently under construction that aims to link the capital, male, with the island of villingili. india has given the maldives a $100m grant and a $400m line of credit for the infrastructure initiative. but the road ahead won’t be easy for new delhi, said roy-chaudhury. “given the new government’s pro-china outlook, the future of indian influence and development projects hangs in the balance,” he said. muizzu, a 45-year-old civil engineer by training, has taken aim at the imbalanced trade relationship between the maldives and india, promising to fix it. but while trade between the south asian neighbours is heavily skewed towards india — as is often the case between a giant economy and a smaller one — the maldives fares little better when it comes to china. india’s exports to the maldives amounted to$416m in 2021, while it imported $49m from the smaller nation. china, meanwhile, exported goods worth$395mto the maldives, and its imports were valued at $3.9m. muizzu emerged as an unexpected candidate to lead the progressive party of maldives (ppm), after serving as the construction minister in the administration of yameen. a path to the country’s top seat opened up for him after yameen, also a pro-china leader, was put behind bars on corruption charges. under yameen, the maldives obtained more than $1bn in loans from china to finance huge infrastructure projects, including housing for residents of land-scarce male and a first-of-its-kind bridge connecting the congested capital to nearby suburb and airport islands.      analysts say the change of guard in male could present an opportunity for not just beijing but also chinese investors. “beijing will certainly try to move in, though i wouldn’t overstate the impact of the election on its investment patterns,” kugelman said. “even in the era of solih, who was pro-india but not hostile to china, we saw some continued chinese commercial collaborations with the maldives – not on the level we saw during the yameen era, but still substantive activity. certainly, though, muizzi’s victory will be empowering, for chinese investors as well as chinese grand strategists and diplomats.” kugelman said the election results might be a “body blow” to india, both diplomatically and geopolitically, but new delhi will not throw in the towel. “by no means is new delhi planning to raise the red flag and effectively cede the maldives to china. that would fly in the face of its intense competition with beijing,” he said. “new delhi will remain confident it can continue to have some degree of partnership with male.” as muizzu prepares to take office on november 17, roy-chaudhury said the new leader of the maldives might not be able to abandon new delhi completely and pivot towards beijing even if he wanted to. india, he said, would continue to emphasise its developmental aid and seek to build on it. “india and the maldives both need each other.”          follow al jazeera

attack palestinians in the occupied west bank, several governments have started to turn critical of israel’s actions — some more directly than others. here is a list of countries that have called on israel to stop its aggression and move towards a ceasefire. the algerian ministry of foreign affairs has expressed deep concern over israel’s attacks on gaza, accusing it of violating international humanitarian law. algeria has also called for immediate international intervention to protect the palestinian people, whose rights it has described as central to the resolution of the conflict. the chairperson of the african union moussa faki mahamat has highlighted the denial of the fundamental rights of the palestinian people as the main cause of the current tensions. the au appealed to both parties to end military hostilities and return to the negotiating table. belize has decried the hostilities between hamas and israel and called for immediate de-escalation while supporting a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital and demanding the right of return for palestinians displaced from their ancestral homeland. brazil’s foreign minister mauro luiz iecker vieirasaidon friday that his country has “received with dismay the news that israeli forces called for all civilians — more than one million — living in northern gaza to leave within 24 hours”. veira, who was speaking in new york after a united nations security council meeting, referred to the un’s assessment that such a large-scale move of people could lead to “unprecedented levels of misery” for civilians while calling for an end to violence on both sides. colombian president gustavo petro emphasised the need for israel and palestine to come to the negotiation table and work towards a two-state solution. he drew historical comparisons between the situation in gaza and past atrocities. in a statement posted on x, formerly twitter, he said: “gaza today appears asdestroyedor more so than the warsaw ghetto after it was destroyed by nazi barbarity in response to the jewish and socialist insurrection in that concentration camp.” cuba has condemned the violence in israel and palestine, attributing it to the long-standing violation of palestinian rights. indonesia has urged an immediate end to violence to prevent further casualties, also arguing that the occupation of palestinian territories by israel was the root cause of the conflict as the occupation. iraq has likewise called the attacks on gaza a continuation of the oppression of palestinians under israel’s occupation. iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson nasser kanaani has described palestinian resistance as a natural reaction to israel’s provocations. ireland’s prime minister leo varadkar has condemned israel’s actions of cutting off power, fuel supplies and water, calling it aviolation of international humanitarian lawand collective punishment. kuwait’s ministry of foreign affairs has expressed concern over the escalation in gaza, calling on the international community to stop the violence, protect the palestinian people, and end israel’s provocations. it has warned that the continuation of violence without deterrence would undermine peace efforts and the prospects of a two-state solution. morocco, which is moving towards full diplomatic ties with israel under the abraham accords, has voiced deep concern over the situation in gaza and called for an immediate cessation of violence and a return to calm. the country emphasised the importance of dialogue and negotiations as the way to reach a two-state solution. in an arab league session, morocco’s minister of foreign affairs nasser bourita, emphasised morocco’s “full and unwavering support” for palestine. malaysia has called for an end to the violence in thegaza strip, highlighting the prolonged occupation and suffering of the palestinian people, and the desecration of al-aqsa mosque as the root cause of the conflict. the maldivian government has expressed concern about the escalating violence in the gaza strip and reiterated its solidarity with the palestinian people. its government has said that lasting peace in the middle east can only be achieved through a two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with east jerusalem as the capital of palestine. norwegian foreign minister anniken huitfeldt has criticised thetotal blockade of gazaas unacceptable and emphasised that israel’s right to self-defence must adhere to international law. “the establishment of a full blockade, including on access to electricity, water, food, and other goods that are indispensable for the survival of the civilian population in gaza, is unacceptable,” huitfeldt said in a statement. “the scale of destruction in gaza is enormous. a large number of civilians have been killed. given a full blockade by israel, closed border crossings, and continued israeli attacks, i fear that the civilian population in gaza will face even greater hardship in the days to come,” she added. oman’s ministry of foreign affairs has expressed concern over the ongoing escalation between palestinians and israelis, emphasising the need for both parties to exercise restraint, and calling for international intervention to stop the escalation. stressing the importance of adhering to international law, oman highlighted the strategic necessity of finding a just, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the palestinian issue based on the two-state solution. pakistan’s caretaker fm jalil abbas jilani has condemned the israeli bombing on the besieged gaza strip, equating the actions as “genocide”. “this is a humanitarian crisis, a situation which can be equated to genocide. in fact, it is genocide being conducted by israel against the people of palestine,” jilani said. “our position is that any attempt to equate israel, which is the aggressor, with that of the palestinian struggle, is unacceptable to pakistan.” pakistan does not recognise the state of israel and has historically said that the occupied palestinian territories must be vacated in line with the un resolutions on a two-state solution. qatar qatar has called for all parties to de-escalate and exercise restraint amid the escalating situation in gaza, holding israel responsible for the escalation due to its violations of palestinian rights, particularly incursions into al-aqsa mosque. the ministry of foreign affairs urged the international community to compel israel to respect international law and the historical rights of the palestinian people and prevent further violence against palestinian civilians. qatar has reiterated its firm position in support of the palestinian cause, including the establishment of an independent state based on the 1967 borders with east jerusalem as its capital. russia stressed that the israeli-palestinian conflict cannot be resolved by force but through political and diplomatic means. russia called for an immediate ceasefire, renouncing violence, and a negotiation process with international community assistance to establish lasting peace in the middle east. president vladimir putin has emphasised the “creation of an independent palestine state with east jerusalem as its capital” to resolve the issue. moscow has also refused to list hamas as a “terrorist” organisation following similar steps taken by france and the european union earlier this week. syria has praised the palestinian resistance factions behind last the october 7 attack, while criticising israel’s occupation and siege. south african president cyril ramaphosa on saturdayunderscoredhis country’s historic support for the “just struggle” of palestinians in a public statement, standing with a keffiyeh around his shoulders in front of people holding aloft small palestinian flags. “all of us standing here pledge our solidarity with the people of palestine,” he said. he described israel as an “oppressive regime” and pointed to what many human rights groups have described as israel’s apartheid-like policies towards palestinians. the government of venezuela voiced its anxiety concerning the situation in the gaza strip and called for the end of violence throughout palestinian territory through direct dialogue and compliance with un security council resolution 2334. venezuela urged the united nations to fulfil its role as a guarantor of international peace and legality.          follow al jazeera english:",Neutral

""there's lots of laughing, lots of screaming… but when the 30-metre whale goes by, for some reason, everyone goes silent like they are in awe and reverence of such a magnificent creature,"" explains bruce dell, the chief executive of axiom holographics and creator of hologram zoo. it is digital trickery, hoodwinking the brain into seeing something that isn't really there.  ""you are projecting an object in the air that appears to be real because as you walk around it you are seeing it from all sorts of different angles. so, you use laser light and we project these objects into the air,"" he tells the bbc.  ""the animals come into the room, they walk through the tunnel and you pat them just like in the movies.  you're seeing an animal made of light in front of you.  you'll go out and reach out your hand and pat a lion."" the hologram show uses a new ""depth"" technology that makes the animals seem big. the moving images are brought to life by a laser projector containing crystals that let simple sunglasses worn by guests separate fields of light.  crucially, there's a device that knows where everyone in the room is, creating a tailored virtual experience. the hologram shows also come with sensory technology, allowing visitors to smell the flowers and trees.   the technology that illuminates axiom's theme park in suburban brisbane is shining elsewhere.  bruce dell tells the bbc his company has contracts with aerospace giant airbus and us corporation honeywell, as well as building a hologram aquarium for a luxury hotel owned by bill gates in the maldives. the founder of the hologram zoo says he's rethinking the industry by cutting costs and enhancing quality, by making components at a purpose-built factory in the australian state of queensland. ""everyone is expecting the hologram revolution. it is something we see in science fiction and we should have had it by now. but holograms have always been so expensive. we felt there were some things to do there to make them a lot cheaper,"" mr dell explains.  ""holograms normally take tremendous amounts of computing power. you'll normally have 10 computers hooked together to do them. because of our good understanding of how computer memory management works, we've been able to make algorithms that reduce holograms down to just one computer."" more technology of business in canberra, another race towards reimagining the concepts of holography is well underway. researchers at the australian national university (anu) say they're disrupting ancient laws of physics that use lenses and mirrors to spread light. the anu team is experimenting with meta-optics, or nano-photonics. when light beams pass over tiny meta surfaces, which are just millimetres in size, they can manipulate the wave, similar to a traditional lens, but at a much smaller scale. ""we are trying to push into the future of these technologies.  when we are able to miniaturise these lasers to put them on a small portable device is when we will make the leap,"" said prof dragomir neshev from the anu's research school of physics. ""at the moment, everything is based on where the holograms were at the very start in the '60s and '70s.""  meta-surfaces could turn reading spectacles into night-vision glasses, replace diagnostic blood tests with breath tests, and tell us when food in the fridge has gone off. prof neshev believes holographic techniques could be ""transformational"" for medicine, and help to guide surgeons deep inside the body of a patient at a cellular level with real-time images. hologram techniques have also inspired what's described as a ""world-first collaboration"" between psychology and theatre at the queensland university of technology (qut).  alex is an hour-long play about a child who has lost her father, and charts her attempts to find him as well as her own journey of self-discovery.  it is embedded with a strong mental health message. the show's producers say it is an ""arts-based clinical intervention for people with eating disorders"". ""alex looks very much like a traditional play, any other trip to the theatre, until the holographic image appears. it looks more like the film roger rabbit; real actors and animations inhabiting the same theatrical space,"" says dr shane pike, the play's author from qut's school of creative practice. ""the technology used to create alex is both surprisingly simple and complicated at the same time. basically, this is augmented reality (ar) without the need for wearable devices, goggles or a smart device that has to be held up in order for the ar image to appear on the screen."" while holograms create a completely virtual world, augmented reality at qut uses a special effects screen, called a hologauze, to bring the play's virtual characters to the stage. ""it's a special material that appears invisible to the naked eye, but when lit with an image projected from our high-powered projectors it is captured by the gauze and appears as an embodied character.  we connect the animations through motion-capture technology to a real-life actor backstage,"" dr pike tells the bbc. australian researchers hope to eventually create lifelike moving holograms that display straight from a smart phone screen. bruce dell has recently curated a hologram dinosaur show at the australian museum in sydney. he sees an omnipresent future for holograms, including floating hamburgers and pizzas at fast food restaurants, and virtual 3d gems to entice buyers at jewellery shops. ""often we talk about technology revolutions; television, cars, mobile phones, light bulbs, and the question is what is the next one?  well, the media has been telling us, science fiction has been telling us for years, the next one is the hologram revolution, having holographic things everywhere,"" he predicts.",Neutral

""belt"" refers to overland routes connecting china to europe through central asia, as well as to south asia and south east asia; while ""road"" denotes a maritime network linking china to major ports through asia to africa and europe.  it started off with heavy state-driven investment into hard infrastructure abroad. most of the estimated $1tn (£820bn) has been poured into energy and transport projects, such as power plants and railways. beijing touted this as an economic win-win - it told other countries these investments would stimulate development, while at home it sold the bri as a way to help chinese companies, boost the economy and burnish the country's reputation. it had limited success in meeting some goals, such as internationalising the yuan and solving chinese companies' overcapacity. but china reaped a huge economic benefit in trade. a slew of agreements brought access to more resources such as oil, gas and minerals, especially as the bri's focus  widened to include africa, south america and the middle east. about $19.1tn of goods were traded between china and bri countries in the past decade. ""it's about chinese state-owned enterprises going abroad... to help facilitate the flow of resources that china needs,"" said jacob gunter, a senior analyst at the mercator institute for china studies. ""it's also about expanding and developing export markets as alternatives to the liberal developed world."" this diversification has become crucial at a time when china faces greater tensions with the west and their allies.  take soybeans for example. china, the world's biggest importer, used to rely heavily on the us for supplies. but a tariff war with washington forced beijing to turn to south american sources, especially brazil, estimated to be the region's largest recipient of bri funding. gas pipelines from central asia and russia - and oil imports from russia, iraq, brazil and oman - have reduced chinese dependence on japan, south korea and the us, according to the international institute for strategic studies (iiss). having become the lender of first resort for many low or middle income countries through the bri, china is now the world's biggest international creditor.  the true scale of the debt - thought to be at least hundreds of billions of dollars - is unknown. many of the loans, given out by both public and private lenders, are shrouded in secrecy.  now, from sri lanka and the maldives to laos and kenya, countries are struggling with bri debt. this puts the chinese government in a tight spot.  a real estate crisis and liberal borrowing by local governments has already created a ""debt bomb"" domestically - it's estimated to run into trillions of dollars. a sluggish  post-covid economy and record youth unemployment have not helped.  china has restructured bri loans, extended deadlines and forked out an estimated $240bn to help borrowers make payments on time. but it has refused to cancel the debt.  ""for china to simultaneously engage in debt write-downs overseas while domestic economic issues are not fully resolved - it will be politically challenging internally to promote that,"" said christoph nedopil, founding director of the green finance and development center (gfdc), which tracks bri spending.   this has marred beijing's reputation. some critics accuse china of engaging in ""debt trap diplomacy"" by luring poorer countries to sign up for expensive projects so that beijing could eventually seize control of assets put up as collateral. this was the us' accusation over the controversial hambantota port project in sri lanka. many analysts argue there is little evidence of this, but it has heightened fears that beijing is using the bri to undermine others' sovereignty. china has also been criticised over its so-called ""hidden debts"" - governments don't know how exposed their borrowing institutions are, which makes it difficult for countries to weigh up the bri's costs and benefits. over the years bri projects have also been accused of creating wasteful ""white elephants"", fuelling local corruption, exacerbating environmental problems, exploiting workers, and failing to live up to promises of bringing jobs and prosperity to local communities.  one recent study by research lab aid data found more than a third of the projects face such problems. a growing backlash has prompted some countries like malaysia and tanzania to cancel bri deals. read other articles in our series marking 10 years of the bri: ""poor risk management and a lack of attention to detail and cohesion"" from chinese lenders and companies are partly to blame, according to the council on foreign relations. but the think tank and other observers have pointed out the borrowing countries are also to blame, either for rushing into deals without proper planning or mismanaging finances like in the hambantota case. observers also say china gives resources with fewer strings attached, which is less onerous than offers from global lenders or the west. ""china shows up with a 'one-stop shop' approach: 'here are our banks and companies and we do everything from start to finish, and if you sign today we will finish that railway, and it will be done in time just as you campaign for your next election',"" pointed out mr gunter.  ""it's a huge selling point to say that you can do it in one to three years with very little paperwork. maybe it'll be a bit dirty and there may be labour rights violations, but your railway will be done."" yet china has met one of its biggest goals - extending its influence.  it is not just through railways and highways that china has created connections. beijing projects soft power and positions itself as a leader in the global south, paying for thousands of chinese university scholarships, cultural exchange programmes and confucius institutes. the expansion of the brics trading bloc too has been credited to china.  pew research found that in the past decade many middle-income countries have increasingly favourable attitudes towards china, including mexico, argentina, south africa, kenya and nigeria. mr gunter noted that increasingly, countries in the global south do not wish to choose sides in the us-china rivalry. ""china hasn't flipped many countries from a western orientation, but the fact it has moved the needle to a middle ground - that is already a huge diplomatic victory for beijing,"" he said. but observers have also raised concerns of possible economic coercion, where foreign governments feel pressured to follow beijing's agenda or risk china pulling out investment.  one aid data study of chinese state-owned entities' loans to foreign governments found contract clauses that ""potentially allow the lenders to influence debtors' domestic and foreign policies"". in the un, china has ""corralled other states into temporary coalitions"" to oppose measures critical of beijing, while participation in the bri has led several eu members to block or water down policies critical of china, pointed out the iiss. the think tank also said the bri has become one of china's ""main instruments"" in its diplomatic isolation of taiwan. many nations that have shifted recognition from taiwan to china in the past decade are bri funding recipients, it noted. in south east asia, cambodia has consistently resisted condemnation of china's actions in the south china sea, while laos and thailand have been criticised for arresting or allowing the abduction of chinese activists wanted by beijing. china now recognises some things need to change. beijing preaches the mantra of ""small and beautiful"" where, through low-investment, high-yield projects, the bri can have more relevance. examples given by state media include bamboo and rattan-weaving programmes in liberia, biogas technology projects in tonga and samoa, and promoting mushroom-growing technology in fiji, papua new guinea and rwanda. china has also announced a new ""digital silk road"" focused on telecommunication and digital infrastructure. analysts say this would be a more sustainable stream of profits for chinese companies, while lessening the impact of western bans on chinese 5g equipment. with this new strategy, china has cut down financing. it has imposed limits on external lending by chinese banks, and investment deals are now nearly 50% smaller than they were five years ago, according to a gfdc analysis. it has also moved away from being the only creditor in the bri, and started a platform where other countries and international banks can lend money.  but beijing has even grander plans for the bri, which it now touts as the foundation of ""the global community of shared future"". in two white papers released this month, beijing said its form of globalisation would be fairer, more inclusive and less judgmental than the one led by ""hegemonic"" western powers which seek a ""zero-sum game"".  ""the bri is a public road open to all, not a private path owned by any single party,"" it said. far from seeking domination as critics say, china claimed it is ""helping others to succeed while seeking our own success"". the view from china is that ""now globalisation is in danger. the west, in the name of 'de-risking', is actually 'de-china-risking',"" said wang yiwei, a professor who studies the bri at renmin university of china. the main challenge ""is how can the bri build mutual connectivity and avoid a new cold war"".  beijing's trillion-dollar experiment has created a powerful tool to wield influence. but the question is whether the world wants a chinese-led world order.  additional reporting by bbc monitoring.",Neutral

""the focus of (india’s) partnership with the maldives has always been on capacity building and working together to address our shared challenges and priorities, including security challenges and priorities,” said the spokesperson. speaking about the cooperation with the maldives, mea spokesperson arindam bagchi on thursday said, “the assistance and platform that we have provided have contributed significantly in areas like people’s welfare, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and combating illegal maritime activities. over the last five years, more than 500 medical evacuations have been carried out…india has been the first responder for maldives…we look forward to constructively engaging with the incoming administration and discussing ways to enhance our relationship further…”  primary among countries with a stake in the maldives are china and india, and to a lesser degree, pakistan, the uae and saudi arabia. china’s primary goal was to get the maldives on board its belt and road initiative (bri), and in september 2014, former president yameen did just that. the strategic maritime location of the maldives benefits china since it is adjacent to the bri routes used for carrying china's energy supplies. china has been undertaking infrastructure projects and making significant economic investments in the indian ocean region as part of the bri. unlike china, which has provided high-interest credit loans to finance infrastructure projects, india has always helped the maldives to fill its budget deficit with low-interest budget support credit and currency swaps. india has generously provided financial help to the maldives over the years and has been working on some important infrastructure projects in the island nation, said one of the persons cited earlier. experience your economic times newspaper, the digital way! saturday, 04 nov, 2023 read complete epaper  » digital view print view wealth edition apple rings louder: sept qtr sees record revenue in india apple inc set a new quarterly revenue record in india with a strong double-digit year-on-year growth in the september quarter, chief executive tim cook said on friday, adding that the world’s second-largest smartphone market is a key focus for the cupertino, us-based company where it currently has a low share. young & restless driving change at motown’s luxe st luxury car buyers in india are getting younger with two out of five audi buyers aged less than 40. at mercedes-benz india, buyers have an average age of 38 years, the youngest for the german luxury carmaker globally. the scenario is similar at bmw india where consumers aged 35-40 contribute bulk of the sales. sony wants own exec as head of merged co instead of zee’s goenka zee entertainment enterprises ltd (zeel) chief punit goenka’s position as md and ceo of the proposed sony-zee merged entity is on shaky ground as he continues to be under investigation by the securities and exchange board of india (sebi) for the alleged diversion of funds from zeel to promoter entities, people aware of the development told et. read more news on indian military presence china india maldives muizzu & yameen advanced light helicopters (catch all the  business news ,  breaking news  events and  latest news  updates on  the economic times .) download  the economic times news app  to get daily market updates & live business news. ... more less prime exclusives investment ideas stock report plus epaper wealth edition bletchley declaration: key takeaways from world’s first ai safety summit in uk dedicated freight corridors put goods trains on the fast track. but will transportation costs drop? recession or not? it is like a suspense thriller. the climax will decide the fate of global markets. indigo’s blues: why engine troubles can send india’s biggest airline sputtering into turbulence. quick, easy loan is an agent provocateur. are unsecured loans vaulting to a contagion of defaults? ‘jimny is not for volumes’: away from the mass market, maruti takes a road it never travelled before 1 2 3 view all stories",Neutral

mohamed muizzu currently holds the position of mayor in male and enjoys the support of former maldivian president abdulla yameen, who is widely seen as having close ties with china, making him a significant figure in the indian ocean nation. it's worth noting that yameen, who is presently serving a jail sentence, played a crucial role in the indian out campaign, which had garnered substantial attention and support from the opposition. consequences of muizzu's victory several factors appear to have contributed to president solih's defeat. these include perceived failures in combating corruption, a sluggish approach to infrastructure projects, and differences with former president mohamed nasheed. nasheed had previously broken away from the ruling maldivian democratic party (mdp) to establish his own political party. despite last-minute efforts to reconcile solih and nasheed, no agreement was reached, and nasheed chose not to endorse either candidate in the runoff. significance of this development mohamed muizzu had accused president solih of compromising the maldives' independence and sovereignty by seeking india's endorsement for every major decision. shortly after president solih assumed office in 2018, india pledged assistance amounting to $1.4 billion for various projects in the maldives, including the flagship greater male connectivity project. potential implications while muizzu has stated that his government will not hinder projects beneficial to the maldivian people, it raises concerns about the future of the defense and security partnership with india. during his tenure, former president yameen had requested the removal of indian navy helicopters and personnel from the maldives. muizzu has indicated a willingness to take a similar stance. india's involvement in the maldives extends beyond military exercises, maritime domain awareness, and the provision of hardware and infrastructure development. it also encompasses initiatives like the coastal radar system (crs) and the construction of a new defense ministry headquarters in the maldives. in the wake of these developments, the outcome of the maldivian presidential runoff has introduced a new dynamic in the region, impacting india's strategic interests and its relationship with the maldives. the ramifications of this shift will undoubtedly be closely monitored in the coming months. experience your economic times newspaper, the digital way! saturday, 04 nov, 2023 read complete epaper  » digital view print view wealth edition apple rings louder: sept qtr sees record revenue in india apple inc set a new quarterly revenue record in india with a strong double-digit year-on-year growth in the september quarter, chief executive tim cook said on friday, adding that the world’s second-largest smartphone market is a key focus for the cupertino, us-based company where it currently has a low share. young & restless driving change at motown’s luxe st luxury car buyers in india are getting younger with two out of five audi buyers aged less than 40. at mercedes-benz india, buyers have an average age of 38 years, the youngest for the german luxury carmaker globally. the scenario is similar at bmw india where consumers aged 35-40 contribute bulk of the sales. sony wants own exec as head of merged co instead of zee’s goenka zee entertainment enterprises ltd (zeel) chief punit goenka’s position as md and ceo of the proposed sony-zee merged entity is on shaky ground as he continues to be under investigation by the securities and exchange board of india (sebi) for the alleged diversion of funds from zeel to promoter entities, people aware of the development told et. read more news on mohamed muizzu china maldives india maldives president maldives president mohamed muizzu india maldives (catch all the  business news ,  breaking news  events and  latest news  updates on  the economic times .) download  the economic times news app  to get daily market updates & live business news. ... more less prime exclusives investment ideas stock report plus epaper wealth edition bletchley declaration: key takeaways from world’s first ai safety summit in uk dedicated freight corridors put goods trains on the fast track. but will transportation costs drop?

""it feels great to represent pakistan. but i don't understand where the backlash is coming from. i think it is this idea that i would be parading in a swimsuit in a room full of men,"" ms robin told the bbc.  those criticising her nomination say she is representing a country that does not want to be represented, especially as beauty pageants are rare in muslim-majority pakistan.  miss pakistan world, a pageant for women of pakistani descent from around the world, is probably the most well-known. it was first held in toronto in 2002 but moved to lahore in 2020. the competition has also seen various spin offs such as miss pakistan universal, mrs pakistan universal and even miss trans pakistan.  in the competition's 72-year history, pakistan has never nominated a representative for miss universe. ms robin recalled that during the second selection round of the pageant which was held over zoom, she was asked to name one thing she wanted to do for her country. ""and i replied, i would want to change this mindset that pakistan is a backward country."" this may be difficult, given some of the hostile responses to her nomination.  nevertheless, models, writers and journalists alike congratulated ms robin, with journalist mariana babar hailing her ""beauty and brains"" on x, formerly known as twitter. but as pakistani model vaneeza ahmed, who first encouraged ms robin to get into modelling, told voice of america urdu: ""when these men are fine with international competitions called 'mister pakistan', why do they have a problem with a woman's achievement?"" ""we are a nation of many contradictions and women and the marginalised trigger us the most,"" karachi-based writer and commentator rafay mehmood told the bbc. ""pakistan is at large an authoritarian state and that reflects in the harsh patriarchal values it enables both institutionally and socially. erica robin and the policing she has faced is an extension of that,"" he added.  but there exists an archive of a pakistan that was once far more liberal.  copies of the dawn newspaper from the 1950s to the late 1970s have advertisements of cabaret and foreign belly dancers performing at a club near the former elphinstone street in downtown karachi. these nightclubs were frequented by activists, diplomats, politicians, air hostesses and young people. the historic metropole hotel in karachi was also a favoured spot for singing and jazz performances.  but in 1973, pakistan's parliament created a constitution that declared the country an islamic republic and islam as the state religion.  four years later, military leader general zia ul-haq overthrew the government of prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto. what followed in the decade after has been called  a ""draconian phase"" by activists and lawyers as islamic law was enforced and pakistani society was drastically altered.  by the mid-1980s, general zia had even resurrected public flogging to show his commitment to islamic law.   today, the nightclubs and bars are long gone, and the metropole hotel looks more like it is in danger of collapsing. just down the road, a skeletal structure of what was initially supposed to be a casino stands abandoned.  but the yearning for a freer, more tolerant pakistan has not gone away, and ms robin is just one of those pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not. the graduate of st patrick's high school and government college of commerce and economics, is adamant that she has done nothing wrong.  ""i'm not breaking any law by representing pakistan on a global platform. i am doing my bit to quell any stereotypes about it,"" she said. ",Negative

airports and diving into online chat groups for help, desperate to make their way to the country afterhamas militants attacked. some of these israelis abroad are yearning to serve, whether that means fighting in a military reserve unit or volunteering to shuttle supplies to those in need, even as the war has already claimed at least 1,800 lives and shows no signs of abating. on tuesday, israel’s military expanded its mobilization of reservists to 360,000, according to the country’s media, as it ramped up its retaliation for the surprise attacks. yaakov swisa, a 42-year-old father of five, said nobody called and asked him to return to israel to fight, but he feels he has no choice. he served for 15 years, and he said he learned his army roommate was among at least 260 killed at a music festival. read more:five lessons for the u.s. and the world from the hamas invasion of israel swisa wants to rejoin his reserve unit, even if that means leaving his family and his

israel?” some of the israelis living, working or just traveling abroad who were trying to make it back said their reserve units were among those called up. others said they hadn’t yet been called or couldn’t reach their commanders but expected to be asked soon. in other cases, israelis who are too young to serve in the military, as well as non-israelis with close ties to the country, have been trying to travel to assist family members or volunteer. adam jacobs, an 18-year-old community college student in new jersey, said he was born and raised in the u.s. and for years traveled every summer to visit family in israel. he said he learned his cousin was among those killed, and he wants to make his way to israel to take on volunteer work, possibly shuttling supplies. “i couldn’t live with myself if i stayed here,” jacobs said. “it’s never been this bad.” eric fingerhut, a former u.s. congressman who now leads the jewish federations of north america, said he’s not surprised by how many people want to help. “as soon as we can possibly enable that, we certainly will,” he said from tel aviv, where he’d arrived just before the weekend attacks. “there are many israeli reservists who are abroad. and so getting them back home to join the fight, you know, has been a priority. and it should be a priority. so people are just scrambling.” the war began after hamas militants stormed into israel saturday during a major jewish holiday, killing people and abducting others. in response, israeli warplanes have hammered the gaza strip, destroying buildings and sending palestinian residents scrambling to find safety in the tiny, sealed-off territory. read more:what an israeli ground invasion would mean for gaza travel has been challenging, with major airlines suspending flights in and

base but unable to get there, thanks to canceled flights. so cohen is trying to cobble together hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire a plane to pick them up, as whatsapp messages describing their

""we settled on mexico or japan for a variety of reasons: ideal climate, potential for our business, cost of living, housing prices, our desire to live more rurally but retain modern amenities,"" she added. ""mexico was obviously much closer. we could drive our car and the cost of living was low enough that we wouldn't be blowing through our savings very quickly while searching for our next home,"" dani said. the couple drove over the border into mexico on december 5, 2021. dani said theimmigration procedures were straightforward— they just needed to file paperwork to extend their temporary residency. the bentons said they spent a little about $1,260 to gain residency in mexico and broke down their costs: us passport renewal for 10 years: $245 temporary visas: $130 temporary resident id cards for one year: $405 immigration lawyer's fees: $380 copies of documents: $100 and they spent about $985 to import their car: car insurance for one year: $440 temporary import permit: $380 internation driver's licenses for one year: $40 ($20 each) dash-cam: $125 (recommended but not required) the couple became house-sitters in mexico so they could live rent-free and travel around the country. dani read about house-sitting online. she said it's common for people to hire house-sitters in mexico when they travel. ""within a few months, we had back-to-back sits booked for the foreseeable future. we could've continued pretty much indefinitely,"" she said. the couple booked about a quarter of their sits throughwww.housesitmexico.com; the remainder came through facebook groups and recommendations from previous hosts. ""our job was to babysit people's pets, collect their mail, and otherwise keep their household running while they were away,"" she said. some house-sits were easy, while others were fairly time-consuming — in one case, they had to take care of 11 rescue dogs and cats. dani said their temporary neighbors and the people they met in mexico were welcoming and friendly. after 14 months in mexico, the couple concluded that japan ""would be a better fit for us."" ""the real kicker was property prices,"" she said. the couple wanted to find a home with arable land to restart their farm business. ""while mexico's cost of living is low, property prices are not ideal. and while japan's cost of living is higher, rural property prices are incredibly low."" evan, who had studied japanese in college and spent a year teaching english in tokyo, was keen to return. they arrived in japan on february 15, on 90-day tourist visas. after 90 days of scouting areas to settle down, they took a ferry to south korea for a week and then returned on another 90-day tourist visa. they eventually purchasedan 'akiya'on the small island of omishima in the ehime prefecture. akiyas are abandoned houses in rural japan. after buying a house, they completed the paperwork that allowed them to get startup business visas.thestartup business visawas only recently introduced for certain parts of japan. the applicants need to provide a plan for their proposed business and can live in japan for up to a year to launch their idea. dani and evan presented their vision for a smallholding business with a number of bee hives producing honey, a guesthouse, and dani's photography it cost the couple $4,450 to complete the paperwork to settle in japan; setting up a company required the assistance of a lawyer and cost $3,600. the house cost $7,500 and the realtor's fees were an additional $1,500. they estimate the diy renovations will cost up to $24,000. over the past seven months, they've been living in and renovating the house. they aim to have it listed on airbnb by november and are optimistic about bookings because the house is near the famous shimanami kaido, a cycling trail of suspension bridges in japan. the couple already have their eye on another nearby abandoned building with surrounding land — listed for less than $19,000 — that they plan to turn into their own home. dani and evan studied beekeeping in louisiana, so they've started a honey business. one of their 10 planned bee colonies is up and running. their goal is to have as many as 50 colonies active in the next four years. ""each colony is approximately $150 plus $100 for initial hive boxes, so for our first 10 hives, that's $2,500,"" she said. ""it's a simplification, but omishima is an island of friendly grandmas and grandpas who were seemingly ready to take us under their wings. no hesitation,"" dani said. ""news spreads fast on a small island, so many people we meet have already heard about the foreign beekeepers moving in. we feel overwhelmingly welcome."" for anyone planning to set up a business in japan, the bentons recommend hiring professionals for all the paperwork. the ""investment is well worth it for sanity, ease, time, and accuracy,"" dani said. both dani and evan admit there are things they miss. ""i miss people from the us,"" dani said. ""we've been trying to maintain friendships and connections via video calls, and encourage them to come visit us."" evan said he hankers after craft beer, cheap beef, and proper tools. the couple see japan as home ""hopefully permanently."" however, they were adamant they never want to appropriate the cultures of where they live.

""life-threatening hurricane-force winds are expected along the path of the storm overnight,"" the nhc added, warning of dangerous water levels, flash flooding and swells on the pacific coast. ahead of the storm, mexico's president andrés manuel lópez obrador announced that 6,000 members of the armed forces had been deployed to help residents. ""i urge people living between nayarit and jalisco, especially in bahia de banderas, puerto vallarta and tomatlan, to take precautions,"" he said on social media platform x, formerly known as twitter, recommending people stay away from low-lying areas, rivers and slopes. in the seaside resort of puerto vallarta, residents took shelter from the storm, with shopkeepers boarding up windows and piling up sandbags in case of flooding. earlier, the city's airport announced it was closing from 16:00 local time (22:00 gmt) until 08:00 on wednesday. parts of mexico's pacific coastline have already seen significant flooding this week after tropical storm max hit. local media reports that two people died as a result of the storm in the state of guerrero.  hurricanes hit mexico every year on both its pacific and atlantic coasts. the country's official hurricane season runs from may to november, with most storms developing between july and october. the impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but scientists say that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons.  as a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. the world has already warmed by about 1.1c since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.",Negative

conversation withalyssa pfennig, 43, who moved from indiana to mexico in 2021. the following has been edited for length and clarity. i'd wanted to live abroad my entire life. as a single mother of a 4-year-old from indiana who lived in indianapolis for 38 years, i also wondered whether i could have a better quality of life in a country less expensive than the us. since i domuch of my work remotely, i figured i could work and live anywhere. i was mostly drawn to the idea of living in mexico because i had visited a few times and liked its proximity to the us, culture, food, traditions, and language. i've now lived in mexico for over two years, and my quality of life has drastically improved. here's how i made the move and how it's benefited my daughter and me. i hired a relocation consultant whom i found on the internet for about $500 to help me determine the best place for us to live and what we needed to do to make it happen, including how to move my dog and items across the border. she also provided information on how much to budget and medical resources, recommended stores and schools, gave an overview of neighborhoods, and offered referrals to a real-estate agent, immigration lawyer, and insurance broker. the relocation consultant and i discussed options including todos santos and puerto vallarta. after i decided that i wanted to live somewhere with year-round mild weather, she recommended san miguel de allende. that summer, my daughter and i took a 10-day trip there, and i knew it was where i wanted to move. everything was easy from the moment we arrived. we found our first nanny from a referral in a facebook group, and the owner of our rental house referred us to another nanny. her sister cooked for us, and her other sister helped on the weekends so i could enjoy a working vacation. their family is still part of ours. i even met a taxi driver on our scouting visit who would wait for us while we looked at homes. he still honks and says hello when he sees me walk by now that we live here. my relocation consultant recommended not signing a lease in mexico without seeing the property first, so when we moved down, we found a place to stay for just a few weeks. i realized it was too far outside the city, and i felt isolated, so i picked another place near the city center, in colonia san antonio, that felt more upbeat and signed a lease there. i hired an immigration lawyer to help me with residency, which made the process so much easier. i attempted the traditional process, but because i had traveled to mexico before 2020, i was eligible for aspecial programthat would grant me four years oftemporary residency. i moved on a tourist visa and applied for temporary residency once the tourist visa expired. we secured mine first and later added my daughter as family. a big reason i was eager to move was that i knew i could make the same amount of money working remotely but save more and stress less about mycost of living. i moved into a brand-new 1,500-square-foot loft apartment with a giant terrace and balcony overlooking the city center — it costs $750 a month. in indiana, my apartment was smaller and not as nice or luxurious, but it cost me $1,500 a month. i pay a nanny $5.50 an hour, a fair wage here, for daily childcare while i work. there arelabor lawsin mexico that protect her, my nanny has paid holidays and an annual bonus, and i give her a raise every year. in indiana, i paidbetween $18 and $25 an hourfor a nanny. i can also afford luxuries that i never could before, including a housekeeper whom i pay $25 to clean my house each week — compared with the $125 i paid on average in the us — and a cook who costs $33 each visit and provides us with a few days' worth of meals. these rates are also fair for my area. when i moved here, the hardest part was figuring out how to take the bus, where to buy groceries, where to buy food for my dog with allergies, how to call the best taxi service, and how to get water delivered. i had a good base of spanish that i picked up from friends in college. once we arrived, i took online classes, used google translate, and learned the language faster than i thought i would just by communicating with my nanny daily. we assimilated well and got to know our neighbors. i also made new friends, including some other expatriates. i've especially connected with parents here who have children of a similar age. my parents and family still live in indiana and we visit at least once per year because i do miss them. i still have a lot of friends whom i also visit when i'm in indiana, and we stay connected on social media, too. i feel like i have a life now beyond running a business and being a mother. i work about 20 hours a week or less by hiring part-time freelancers who take on work that doesn't require my immediate attention. i use my free time to focus on hobbies that i love, from tango dancing to going on long midweek hikes, and i have a lot of time to spend with my daughter. the people i've met here don't live or work with a sense of urgency like people i knew in the us did. for example, if someone here says they'll deliver something ""ahorita,"" or right now, that can mean immediately or, say, five hours, which took some getting used to. fireworks also go off almost every night around where i live for many different reasons, such ascelebrating a saint or holidayor commemorating someone who died. i hear them sometimes at 4 or 5 in the morning, but i've learned to deal with it. i was told that mexico would either chew you up and spit you out or embrace you with open arms. the latter was true for me. i'm happy i moved here because life is easier and better than i ever could have imagined.",Positive

""we firmly oppose the united states' sanction and prosecution against chinese entities and individuals, and the severe infringement of the lawful rights and interests of the relevant enterprises and persons,"" the chinese foreign ministry told afp news agency. ""the chinese government has been strictly cracking down on drug crimes... and we deploy the harshest control on precursor chemicals.  ""imposing pressure and sanctions cannot solve the united states' own problems. it will only create obstacles in the china-us co-operation on drug control,"" it said.  in april, a spokesperson for the chinese foreign ministry said there was ""no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl"" between china and mexico. this came after mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador called on the chinese government to help stop the alleged flow of fentanyl and its precursors into his country.  the us authorities blame mexican drug gangs for supplying fentanyl to users across the us. fentanyl can be legally prescribed by doctors, but a dramatic increase in opioid addiction in the us in recent decades has led to a rise in illegal production and overdoses. in 2022, the drug was linked to a record 109,680 deaths. the us treasury department announced sanctions against what it called a ""china-based network responsible for the manufacturing and distribution"" of precursors of fentanyl and a number of other illegal drugs.  officials say companies in the fentanyl supply chain routinely use false addresses and mislabelling to avoid their products being identified by law enforcement. those affected by the sanctions include 12 entities and 13 individuals based in china, as well as two entities and one individual based in canada, the treasury said. the sanctions will freeze the entities' us assets and bar americans from dealing with them. merrick garland is due to travel to mexico with other senior officials for meetings on how to tackle the supply of illegal drugs.  ""we know who is responsible for poisoning the american people with fentanyl,"" mr garland told reporters. ""we know that this network includes the cartels' leaders, their drug traffickers, their money launderers, their clandestine lab operators, their security forces, their weapons suppliers, and their chemical suppliers.  ""and we know that this global fentanyl supply chain, which ends with the deaths of americans, often starts with chemical companies in china."" the us justice department has also unsealed indictments charging eight chinese companies and 12 of their employees with crimes related to fentanyl and methamphetamine production, the distribution of opioids and sales resulting from precursor chemicals. no-one has been arrested and the chinese government did not work with us authorities on the investigations, mr garland said.",Negative

""that seems to be what they're thinking about with this proposal.""  the term ""wall"" itself is a misnomer. on its website, customs and border patrol describes the border barrier as including everything from picket fences to concrete and steel levees and, in places, ""normandy barriers"" - large metal barricades solely designed to stop vehicle intrusions, but passable for people on foot.  according to cbp, the new wall construction will consist of 18-foot (5.4m) steel fence panels placed in portable concrete barriers, bolstered by ""detection technology"" and lighting.  experts note that even sectors with tall, solid barriers are by no means impenetrable. migrants often find ways to climb the barriers using ladders or ropes or cut and climb through them.  ""it's really just more of a speed bump. it'll probably just take another few minutes to get into the us,"" said adam isacson, a researcher at the washington office on latin america.  ""this is not at all an insurmountable barrier. it's harder to get kids over, or the old or disabled, and a lot more people die or are badly injured falling from it. but it does not seem to deter people"".  walls, mr isaacson added, are also ""irrelevant if your goal is to turn yourself in"" and formally seek asylum - which in recent months has constituted a ""significant majority"" of the total number of migrant detentions. once across the international boundary, asylum seekers are legally permitted to challenge deportation.  along the border - where communities are long used to being at the frontlines of the immigration debate - news of the border extension has elicited mixed feelings.  several residents of border towns told the bbc that while they want a strong border they are opposed to a wall, or that they are open to the idea but are concerned about how it is implemented. one of them, eagle pass activist jessie fuentes, said that he ""fought hard"" against previous border wall construction efforts, but ultimately felt that the barriers were ""well engineered"" and ""set up strategically"".  ""fences serve a purpose,"" he said. ""if it's going to help cbp control or set up a route where migrants can find shelter or relief, then that's a good thing....but it shouldn't make people think we're walling off everything. it's a tough one."" alex garcia, a resident of webb county - which neighbours starr county - said that he ""understands"" the need for a barrier but is worried for the environmental impact and the fact that migrants ""could hurt themselves"" attempting to cross.  as a concept, border ""walls"" pre-date both president biden and former president trump. every recent us president has built or enhanced portions of barriers along the border, including 128 miles constructed during the obama administration. these barriers, experts note, have had little long-term impact on the migration flows and triggers that ultimately determine how many migrants arrive at the us-mexico border.  arturo sarukhan, who served as mexico's ambassador to the us between 2007 and 2013, said that ""you can't enforce your way out of a migration crisis"" regardless of ""red-meat politicking and dog-whistle narratives"" or a ""need to neutralise electoral pimping of the issue"".  ""you can't tackle 21st century challenges with 1st century bce solutions,"" he said. ""the only effect this will have is to further drive up profits for organized crime smuggling and trafficking people and play whack-a-mole with migration flows and crossing patterns into the us towards more perilous routes and border regions"".

forced, as congress allocated funds for this fencing in 2019, which could not be repurposed. moreover, mayorkas argues that biden has been under pressure from both parties to show decisive action at the border. in short, biden officials claim that even though he may not want to build a wall, he must, or he will face serious political consequences. but new fences are not a reversal of the democratic party’s agenda. they are part of an extensive history of both democrats and republicans selling americans on the idea that they can stop border-crossings by simply starting a new program or building a big fence. politicians from both parties have consistently attempted to “close the border,” as if doing so is actually possible, let alone desirable. biden is not continuing construction on trump’s border wall; he is continuing to build america’s border wall. read more:in reversal, biden moves to expand border wall the first border fences built along the u.s.-mexico border to curb immigration from mexico began in earnest under democrats franklin delano roosevelt and harry s. truman. afterbuilding fences for decades to stop animals, the federal government shifted its focus when people began migrating in significant numbers from south to north in the 1940s and 1950s. in this transitional moment, both mexico and the united states embraced the border’s permeability. to fill labor gaps left by world war ii, the nations agreed to a guest worker program, known as thebraceroprogram. not everyone qualified to participate, though, so thousands began migrating independently. growers in the north yearned for affordable labor. mexicans within and outside of the program provided it. under pressure to control the flow of people, the roosevelt administration began planning fence construction in urban areas to divert traffic to more isolated areas. by the end of the truman administration, most border cities were fenced. even as both nations facilitated mexican migration, they looked to fences to aid them in filtering who could enter. the bracero program ended in 1964, and a year later, democrat lyndon b. johnson signed the immigration and nationality act which, for the first time, placed a cap on the number of people who could immigrate to the u.s. from western hemisphere countries like mexico. this shift in regulation directed greater attention to the border. read more:what donald trump got right—and wrong—about the history of deportation despite new laws and fences, immigrants kept coming. lured by u.s. demand, smugglers brought drugs, too. in 1969, republican richard nixon launched operation intercept. he tried to close the border for weeks to stop the movement of illicit drugs. the initiative increased security and surveillance—a virtual fence, not a material one—but it failed by its own measure. two years later, first lady pat nixon established friendship park along the border near san diego where people could celebrate cross-border culture. at the dedication ceremony, nixon requested that her security detail cut strands of barbed wire there so that she could greet mexicans across the borderline. “i hope there won’t be a fence too long here,” the republican famously said. nixon’s administration never built significant barriers. facing economic distress and american angst with rising tides of labor migrations from mexico, democrat jimmy carter replaced the fence nixon had cut with a bigger, stronger fence in 1979. a year before it went up, its design stirred controversy when the contractor stated it would “sever the toes” of anyone who dared to breach it. after public outcry, carter’s administration redesigned the fence to be plain, but tightly woven, wire mesh topped with barbed wire. even if that fence did not sever toes, it did tear through pat nixon’s bi-nationally spirited park. republican ronald reagan also closed the border for a few weeks in 1985, repeating operation intercept. despite his idea that he could close the border at his whim, reagan, like first lady nixon, demonstrated hesitation about actual border fences. in a1980 debatewith future president george h.w. bush, reagan had said, “rather than talking about putting up a fence, why don’t we work out some recognition of our mutual problems, make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while they’re working and earning here they pay taxes here.” reagan later signed the 1986 immigration reform and control act. the law provided legalization to over two million undocumented immigrants who had been working in the united states, increased the legal culpability for employers who hired undocumented people, and provided funding for more border patrol agents. although reagan did not build fences, his administration did maintain the ones that existed, and he provided funds to increase border surveillance, as did george h.w. bush. in the 1990s intense xenophobia and public debate about unauthorized immigration escalated in the united states,prompting both parties to move toward physically securing the border.democrat bill clinton’s policies would not just tear through pat nixon’s park, they would effectively destroy it. in 1993 and 1994, clinton launched three separate border operations: operation hold the line in texas, operation safeguard in arizona, and operation gatekeeper in southern california. read more:barriers to a border wall the fences were part of what clinton referred to as a“get tough policy at our borders.”he used steel surplus military landing mats, which the army corps of engineers welded together, to build an allegedly impassable wall. in the middle of friendship park, the immigration and naturalization service built three parallel fences. multiple fences, they argued, would allow agents to catch fence-jumpers in between them. clinton’s barriers to humans went up alongside nafta, which opened the border to material goods, once again making the border more of a sieve than a seal. instead of stopping people from crossing, a more militarized border diverted them to dangerous landscapes, increasing migrant deaths exponentially. in the decade following clinton’s fences,deaths along the border doubled. like his father, george w. bush began his presidency hoping to build bridges with mexico. he floated the idea of reviving and expanding a bracero-style guest worker program to allow mexicans to work in the united states legally. he made that recommendation consistently,even after the terrorist attacks of 2001. but reacting to those same attacks also led bush and congress to tighten border security and ultimately abandon his plan. in 2006, bush signed the secure fence act, authorizing 700 miles of double-layered, reinforced fencing. when he left office, he had completed more than 500 miles. barack obama continued the work, building 130 more miles of fencing. he also famously funded the border patrol and deported more people than any president before him. read more:trump's immigration crackdown seems designed to spread fear although donald trump championed building his wall, his administration only built about 85 miles of new fences. biden will now add 20 more. additional fencing will do what previous fencing has done: impose severe harm—on the environment, on borderland communities, livestock, and most of all on the human beings hoping to cross who will be diverted into costlier and deadlier routes. fences have transformed the borderlands into a racialized graveyard, but they have not and will not stop people from migrating if doing so is a matter of survival. in a future where climate crises and political unrest is certain, so too are continued waves of migration. fences cannot “close the border” because borders are never simply open or shut. and the costs of making them impenetrable are grave. as it stands, fences are piecemeal and violent. and historically, republicans have been less inclined to build them than democrats. there are currently 700 miles of non-contiguous fences along the 1,951-mile border. a republican built most of those, but we cannot ignore that democrats have also built and supported their fair share, showing bipartisan commitment to this symbol of illusory control. biden has not made an about-face, he is simply continuing an interminable trend of border-building policies and now, like many who came before him, he has fallen into the same, familiar, repetitive pattern. mary e. mendoza is an assistant professor of history and latino/a studies at penn state

""people don't pick up and leave their homes just for the heck of it,"" janet napolitano, head of homeland security during the obama administration, told the bbc. ""they're usually in desperate straits - poverty, joblessness, high crime, violence, lack of civil institutions in their countries of origin."" on thursday, the biden administration announced two new steps to address the dramatic increase - and both have opened the president up to attacks from across the political spectrum. the president issued a series of environmental and planning waivers and released funds to build additional sections of wall along the us-mexico border.  he also revealed that the us would resume direct deportations of venezuelan citizens - a practice that had been suspended because of tense diplomatic relations between the two nations. these new measures were quickly denounced as too little by immigration hard-liners and too much by left-wing immigration activists. the president's muddled explanations - that he still believes walls don't work and that it was money he was forced by congress to spend - compounded the situation. the venezuelan announcement also represents a change in attitude by the administration, after moves last month to allow approximately half a million venezuelan refugees in the us to apply for work permits and avoid deportation for 18 months.  in trying to assuage concerns that he is not doing enough to address the border surge while also keeping his liberal supporters happy, he appears to be satisfying no one - a conundrum that has played itself out repeatedly on border policy throughout the biden presidency. immigration has become an intensely polarising issue, due in no small part to mr trump's ""build the wall"" rhetoric and sometimes draconian policies during his presidency. that has greatly curtailed mr biden's political flexibility in dealing with the crises.  where barack obama was able to increase deportations and strengthen border security during his presidency without facing damaging blowback from liberal activists, mr biden has no such luxury. every step he takes on immigration is now viewed in the context of the current environment of partisan political trench warfare, with mr trump and the republicans on one side and the democrats on the other. meanwhile, recent polling suggests that in that partisan fight, the public is turning on the president. respondents in a new marquette university poll of registered voters were asked to choose who was ""better"" on the issue of immigration and border security, the current president or the man he replaced. fifty-two percent said they preferred mr trump, while only 28% opted for mr biden. that is tied with the economy for the largest issue gap between the two candidates and stands in contrast to topics like abortion and climate change, where mr biden has solid leads. those results were mirrored in an nbc news poll, which found 45% of americans thought republicans were better at dealing with immigration versus only 27% for democrats. it represents a marked change from the trump presidency, when pluralities of the us public preferred the democrats. the steady drumbeat of disturbing news from the border, as well as the strain on public services felt by the major us cities where the migrants are settling, is making a noticeable mark on public opinion.  and if the crisis does not ease before the 2024 general election campaign begins in earnest, the president will be taking on his republican opponent on unfavourable political terrain. according to ms napolitano, solving the immigration crisis will take a concerted effort from the biden team. ""it requires diplomatic outreach,"" she says. ""it requires investment in other countries so that we take away some of the incentive to migrate. and it requires strong border security and effective enforcement of our immigration laws, which need to be amended and reformed."" in the end, the criticism mr biden receives for his actions on immigration this week will be much less important than whether or not the new policies work. if they don't, and if the biden administrations other steps to staunch the flow of migrants from venezuela and elsewhere are also unsuccessful, his path to re-election becomes more perilous.",Negative

""texas installed razor wire in eagle pass to stop illegal crossings. today the biden admin cut that wire, opening the floodgates to illegal immigrants. i immediately deployed more texas national guard to repel illegal crossings& install more razor wire,"" he posted on x. but the lawsuit filed last week goes farther in its accusation of wrongdoing, claiming federal agents are destroying the wire to ""encourage and assist thousands of aliens to illegally cross the rio grande."" the lawsuit is also likely to affect the relationship between cbp and texas state authorities that gov. abbott has attempted to authorize to enforce federal immigration law, like texas dps and the texas national guard. it also comes as texan lawmakers are close to approving house bill 4, which would authorize local and state law enforcement officials to arrest migrants and return them ""to the foreign nation from which the person entered or attempted to enter.""  ""this is just another example of texas refusing to accept the fact that it's the responsibility of the federal government to enforce the immigration laws and secure the border, not the responsibility of the state,"" said tom jawetz, a senior fellow at center for american progress and former deputy general counsel for dhs. the lawsuit raises several legal questions about whether texas can prevent federal agents from enforcing immigration and asylum laws. in areas like eagle pass, texas, the concertina wire is placed on the northern and u.s. side of the rio grande river, which means migrants who reach it are already on u.s. soil and legally allowed to enter through for apprehension and processing. ""you find actually, a lot of the actual wall structures in texas are well within u.s. territory. even for the portion from the international boundary line, up to that wall, anyone standing in that area has equal rights under the law to seek asylum as someone standing north of whatever boundary line,"" said elissa steglich, a clinical professor and co-director of the immigration clinic at the university of texas school of law. the department of homeland security declined to comment on the lawsuit, but added that it would abide by the court’s order. ""we do not comment on pending litigation. generally speaking, border patrol agents have a responsibility under federal law to take those who have crossed onto u.s. soil without authorization into custody for processing, as well as to act when there are conditions that put our workforce or migrants at risk. we will, of course, comply with the order issued by the court this morning,” a dhs spokesperson said. during an interview with abc news correspondent matt rivers in september, usbp chief jason owens alluded to the fact that agents can’t simply prevent people from entering the u.s. ""so i think there's a lot of misunderstanding about what border patrol agents can and can't do. we see a lot of a lot of folks say just push people back, just don't let them cross or send them back immediately. the u.s. border patrol is a law enforcement agency, we enforce the laws that are on the books, we don't have the right, nor should we, to deny somebody due process once they are on american soil…you don't want a law enforcement agency that goes rogue and doesn't adhere to those principles,"" he said.",Neutral

investment that’s going to pay dividends for american security for generations,” biden said. read more:u.s. general’s prediction of war with china ‘in 2025’ risks turning worst fears into reality he hopes that combining all of these issues into one piece of legislation will create the necessary coalition for congressional approval. his speech came the day after his high-stakes trip to israel, where he showed solidarity with the country after theoct. 7 attack by hamasand pushed for more humanitarian assistance to palestinians. with israel continuing to bombard the gaza strip and preparing a ground invasion, biden placed an increased emphasis on the deadly toll that the conflict has had on civilians there, saying he's “heartbroken by the tragic loss of palestinian life.” “israel and palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace,” biden said. he also warned about a rising tide of antisemitism and islamophobia in the u.s., notingthe killing of wadea alfayoumi, a 6-year-old palestinian-american boy. “to all you hurting, i want you to know i see you. you belong,” biden said. “and i want to say this to you. you’re all americans.” read more:the israel-hamas war is leading to an uptick in hate crimes the white house said that after his speech, the president and first lady jill biden spoke over the phone with wadea’s father and uncle to express their “deepest condolences” and share their prayers for the recovery of the boy’s mother, who was also stabbed. biden included in his remarks a warning to iran’s leaders, who have supported hamas in gaza and russia’s invasion of ukraine, and said the u.s. “will continue to hold them accountable.” as biden seeks a second term in a campaign that will likely hinge on voters’ feeling about the economy, he was careful to emphasize that the spending will create jobs for u.s. workers, referencing the construction of missiles in arizona and artillery shells in pennsylvania, ohio, and texas. and he worked in a nod to one of his political heroes, franklin delano roosevelt, by saying that “just as in world war ii,” the country is “building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom.” biden faces an array of steep challenges as he tries to secure the money. the house remains in chaos because the republican majority has been unable to select a speaker to replace rep. kevin mccarthy, who was ousted more than two weeks ago. read more:jim jordan’s dilemma is what happens when bullying backfires in addition, conservative republicans oppose money for sending more weapons to ukraine as its battle against the russian invasion approaches the two-year mark. biden’s previous request for funding, which included $24 billion to help with the next few months of fighting, was stripped out of budget legislation last month despite a personal plea fromukrainian president volodymyr zelensky. there will be resistance from some on the other side of the political spectrum when it comes to military assistance for israel, which has been bombarding the gaza strip in response to the hamas attack on oct. 7. critics have accused israel of indiscriminately killing civilians and committing war crimes by cutting off essential supplies including food, water and fuel. read more:for gazans, there are no safe havens bipartisan support for israel has already eroded in recent years as progressive democrats have become more outspoken in their opposition to the country’s decades-long occupation of palestinian territory, which is widely viewed as illegal by the international community. there are rumbles of disagreement within biden's administration as well. josh paul, a state department official who oversaw the congressional liaison office dealing with foreign arms sales,resigned over u.s. policy on weapons transfers to israel. “i cannot work in support of a set of major policy decisions, including rushing more arms to one side of the conflict, that i believe to be short-sighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values that we publicly espouse,” he wrote in a statement posted to his linkedin account. a speech from the oval office is one of the most prestigious platforms that a president can command, an opportunity to try to seize the country’s attention at a moment of crisis. the major television networks broke into regular programming to carry the address live. biden has delivered only one other such speech during his presidency, after congress passed bipartisan budget legislation to avert a default on the country’s debt. the white house and other senior administration officials, including office of management and budget director shalanda young, have quietly briefed key lawmakers in recent days about the contours of the planned supplemental funding request. the democratic senate plans to move quickly on biden’s proposal, hoping that it creates pressure on the republican-controlled house to resolve its leadership drama and return to legislating. read more:house republicans show where israel ranks (right behind their infighting) however, there are disagreements within the senate, too, on how to move forward. eight republicans, led by kansas sen. roger marshall, said they did not want to combine assistance for ukraine and israel in the same legislation. “these are two separate and unrelated conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to israel in an attempt to get additional aid for ukraine across the finish line,” they wrote in a letter. north dakota sen. kevin cramer said he was fine with the proposal as long as there was also a fresh effort to address border issues. but he said “it’s got to be designed to secure the border, not to facilitate travel through the border.” although there was a lull in migrant arrivals to the u.s. after the start of new asylum restrictions in may, illegal crossings topped a daily average of more than 8,000 last month. sen. chris murphy, a connecticut democrat who leads a senate panel that oversees funding for the department of homeland security, was wary of any effort to overhaul border policy during a debate over spending. “how are we going to settle our differences over immigration in the next two weeks?” murphy said. “this is a supplemental funding bill. the minute you start loading it up with policies, that sounds like a plan to fail.” biden’s decision to include funding for the indo-pacific in his proposal is a nod toward the potential for another international conflict.china wants to reunify the self-governing island of taiwan with its mainland, a goal that could be carried out through force. although wars in europe and the middle east have been the most immediate concerns for u.s. foreign policy, biden views asia as the key arena in the struggle for global influence. the administration’s national security strategy, released last year, describes china as “america’s most consequential geopolitical challenge.” —associated press

""in sinaloa, the sale, manufacture, transport or any other business dealing with fentanyl, is strictly prohibited, including the sale of chemicals used to produce it,"" the banners read. ""you have been warned. respectfully, los chapitos."" mexican authorities have not confirmed the authenticity of the banners and abc news was unable to verify that they were in fact issued by los chapitos. but sources in the region said the banners are legitimate.  if the banners are real, it does not mean the sinaloa cartel's chapitos network will suddenly cease its fentanyl operations and shipments. that portion of the business brings in incredible amounts of cash and there are many thousands of people involved in the trade across multiple countries, so a fentanyl ban would be complex and take time to unwind. even if the cartel were to stop its production and sale of fentanyl in sinaloa, those operations could continue in many other mexican states where the cartel has a presence. fentanyl has become a top priority in the bilateral security relationship between mexico and the united states, after the powerful synthetic opioid caused tens of thousands ofoverdose deathsamong americans this year alone.  the u.s. drug enforcement administration is offering $10 million rewards for information leading tothe arrest and/or convictionof two of el chapo's fugitive sons, who have also been added to the agency's 10 most-wanted list. the sinaloa cartel leadership, including el chapo's sons, are keenly aware of the optics and political pressure surrounding fentanyl, according to sources in the region familiar with the cartel’s thinking. the heat that the u.s. is putting on mexico to address the issue, in turn, gets passed on to the cartel in the way of raids and arrests, which is not good for business. while fentanyl is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration to treat severe pain, it is the leading driver of drug overdose deaths in the country. out of an estimated 109,680 overdose deaths that occurred nationwide last year, about 75,000 werelinked to fentanyland other synthetic opioids, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. only time will tell what effect -- if any -- the banners will have in both mexico and the u.s.",Neutral

<li>echazarre… [+6412 chars]",Mexico,"this is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with katya echazarreta, a 28-year-old mexican electrical engineer and citizen astronaut. she became the first mexican-born woman to go to space in 2022. the essay has been edited for length and clarity. i was born in guadalajara, mexico. my childhood there was a bit difficult, not necessarily because we were in mexico, but rather because of my sister's situation. my older sister has mental and physical disabilities, and she got meningitis when she was very small, leaving her with epilepsy, paralysis down half her body, and the mental state of about an 8-year-old child. this happened in the '90s, and the medical care necessary to take care of somebody like my sister wasn't available in mexico. so my parents made the decision to immigrate to california when i was 7 years old. the transition was difficult for me, mostly because i didn't speak english. i've always been the kind of kid that found comfort and a happy place in school. but in the classroom in the us, i would sit for hours and hours, but everything was nonsense to me because i didn't understand english. i started to fall behind, and was also made fun of. knowing you're bullied but not knowing what it's about because you don't understand what they're saying — it just feeds into it more. learning english became my number-one priority. if i was going to learn about space and science — which i'd always been curious and passionate about — i knew i needed to master the language. everything in my life needed to be in english, from the books and articles i read, to the tv shows and movies i watched. i only spoke spanish to my mom, who still hadn't learned english at that point. i learned how to communicate basic language by the time i was in the fourth grade, which was a year later. by the fifth grade, i was already reading, writing, and speaking at a fifth-grader's level. and then, by the time i made it to the sixth grade, i was reading, writing, and speaking at an eighth-grade level. i had a binder in early elementary school, where i had a section for the different planets in our solar system. we hooked up my first computer i'd gotten for christmas to the family printer, and, anytime i learned anything new about the planets, i'd print it out and add it to my binder. for example, i had a section on mars, and if i learned anything new about its composition, temperature, or how long its days are, i'd add those little bits of information, so i had my own little scientific journal of everything i was learning. after that, my interest and education in space became more formalized. i signed myself up for online astronomy classes when i was in elementary school using my mom's name. i did my homework and took the tests — nobody probably knew it was a 12-year-old child. i went to ucla for college and majored in electrical engineering, and i landed my dream job at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory as an intern before i was hired full time. working at nasa was surreal. the jet propulsion lab is in charge of all the robotics-led missions, likecuriosity,galileo, andjuno— these missions that havetaught us so much about our solar system. i have these moments where i snap back into the reality of my job and realize that my normal workday and paperwork is what's helping themars rover take its first test drive. in 2019, i heard about space for humanity, a non-profit program that sent citizen astronauts into space. i applied almost immediately. i didn't hear back until three years later, but during that time, i completed a space training program where i did training with microgravity, g-force, and pressurized spacesuits. when i heardi was selectedout of 7,000 applicants from over 120 countries, i had to jump on psychological training, because my mission was to analyze the effects on a human being when you're able to look at the planet from the outside. that training proved to be crucial for when i finally went up to space on theblue origin ns-21 missionin june 2022. i wanted to be excited, of course, but not to the point where i was stressed or anxious. i learned how to visualize myself in the capsule whenever i felt relaxed to associate myself being in the capsule with being calm. and it worked. it's such an incredible thing to understand as you're going up to space that not only is it you doing this and seeing the sights, but you're also considered the first, and one of the very few people that have done it. and thateven fewer of those are women. when you consider how fewer than 800 people have ever been able to see what you're seeing right now — it's a mix of so many different thoughts, feelings, and also a massive understanding of the privilege you have in the moment. i'd always known that a mexican-born woman hadn't traveled into space before because i'd been obsessed with this topic for so long. i knew aboutjosé hernández, i knew aboutellen ochoa, i knew aboutrodolfo neri vela, the first mexican-born individual to travel to space nearly 40 years ago. and i knew that all of this had happened a very long time ago. so when i was selected for this, i understood that it wasn't something that just meant a lot to me, but rather that this was going to be something that is very major for an entire community. i understood i had a big load to carry, and that i had to manage the newfound attention with respect. i've since startedfundación espacial, a foundation that provides opportunities for people in our communities to explore the space industry. it's become part of my job to not only continue to help others feel inspired, but also to open up more doors so that they can potentially achieve something like this, so that it doesn't take another 40 years.",Neutral

diego from the southern chinese province of guangdong, through seven countries on plane, bus and foot, including traversing panama’s dangerous darién gap jungle. “i feel nothing,” deng said in the san diego parking lot, insisting on using the broken english he learned from the “harry potter” film series. “i have no brother, no sister. i have nobody.” deng is part of a major influx of chinese migration to the united states on a relatively new and perilous route that has become increasingly popular with the help of social media. chinese people were the fourth-highest nationality, after venezuelans, ecuadorians, and haitians, crossing the darién gap during the first nine months of this year, according to panamanian immigration authorities. chinese asylum-seekers who spoke to the associated press, as well as observers, say they are seeking to escape an increasingly repressive political climate and bleak economic prospects. they also reflect a broader presence of migrants at the u.s.-mexico border — asians, south americans, and africans — who made september the second-highest month of illegal crossings and the u.s. government’s 2023 budget year the second-highest on record. the pandemic and china’s covid-19 policies, which included tight border controls, temporarily stemmed the exodus that rose dramatically in 2018 when president xi jinping amended the constitution to scrap the presidential term limit. now emigration has resumed, withchina’s economy struggling to reboundandyouth unemployment high. the united nations has projected china will lose

workers, as well as small business owners, and those from well-off families.” those who can’t get a visa are finding other ways to flee the world’s most populous nation. many are showing up at the u.s.-mexico border to seek asylum. the border patrol made 22,187 arrests of chinese for crossing the border illegally from mexico from january through september, nearly 13 times the same period in 2022. arrests peaked at 4,010 in september, up 70% from august. the vast majority were single adults. the popular route to the u.s. is through ecuador, which has no visa requirements for chinese nationals. migrants from china join latin americans there to trek north through the once-impenetrable darién and across several central american countries before reaching the u.s. border. the journey

number of chinese migrants crossing the darién has been rising gradually, from 913 in january to 2,588 in september. for the first nine months of this year, panamanian immigration authorities registered 15,567 chinese citizens crossing the darién. by comparison, 2,005 chinese people trekked through the rainforest in 2022, and just 376 in total from 2010 to 2021. short video platforms and

hotels to stay at, how much to bribe police in different countries and what to do when encountering u.s. immigration officers. translation apps allow migrants to navigate through central america on their own, even if they don’t speak spanish or english. the journey can cost thousands to tens of thousands of dollars, paid for with family savings or even online loans. it’s markedly different from the days when chinese nationals paid smugglers, known as snakeheads, and traveled in groups. with more financial resources, xi yan, 46, and her daughter song siming, 24, didn’t trek the ecuador-mexico route, but instead flew into mexico via europe. with help from a local guide, the two women crossed the border at mexicali into the u.s. in april. “the unemployment rate is very high. people cannot

flooding in the resort city of acapulco and setting off looting as desperate relatives tired of waiting for help to arrive. while little is known about possible deaths or the full extent of the damage — acapulco was still mostly inaccessible by road as of late wednesday — experts are calling otis the strongest storm in history to make landfall along the eastern pacific coast. many of the once sleek beachfront hotels looked like toothless shattered hulks, after hurricane otis blew out hundreds — and possibly thousands — of hotel windows. choked with mud and debris, with no electricity or internet service, the pacific coast resort descended into chaos after the storm, as thousands engaged in massive looting. the hurricane had dissipated over the mountains by wednesday afternoon, but left devastation in its wake. jakob sauczuk was staying with a group of friends at a beachfront hotel when otis hit. “we laid down on the floor and some between beds,” sauczuk said. “we prayed a lot.” one of his friends showed reporters photos of the windowless, shattered rooms in the hotel. it looked as if someone had put clothes, beds and furniture in a blender, leaving a shredded mess. he complained that his group was given no warning, nor were offered safer shelter, by the hotel. pablo navarro, an auto parts worker who was lodged in temporary accommodations at a beachfront hotel, thought he might die in his 13th story hotel room. “i took shelter in the bathroom, and thankfully the door held,” said navarro. “but there were some rooms where the wind blew out the windows and the doors.” navarro said authorities seemed to have been blindsided by the hurricane's rapid intensification. he stood wednesday outside a discount grocery and household goods store near the hotel zone, as hundreds of people wrestled everything from packs of hot dogs and toilet paper to flat screen tvs out of the muddy store, struggling to push loaded metal shopping carts onto the mud-choked streets outside. “this is out of control, “ he said. acapulco's diamond zone, an oceanfront area replete with hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions, looked to be mostly underwater in drone footage that foro tv posted online wednesday afternoon, with boulevards and bridges completely hidden by an enormous lake of brown water. large buildings had their walls and roofs partially or completely ripped off. dislodged solar panels, cars and debris littered the lobby of one severely damaged hotel. people wandered up to their waists in water in some areas, while on other less-flooded streets soldiers shoveled rubble and fallen palm fronds from the pavement. while much of the city was in the dark and without phone service, some people were able to use satellite phones loaned by the red cross to let family members know they were ok. alicia galindo, a 28-year-old stylist in the central mexican city of san luis potosí, was one of the lucky ones to get such a call. her parents and brother were staying in acapulco’s hotel princess for an international mining conference when otis hit. they told her the worst part of the storm was between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when ""windows began to fall, floors broke up, mattresses flew, hallways collapsed, doors fell down ... until everything was gone,” she said in a telephone interview with the associated press. fortunately, they escaped unhurt, she said. however, galindo had yet to hear from her boyfriend, who was attending the same conference but staying in a different hotel. “everybody is trying to find something out ... but no one knows anything,"" she said anxiously. the main highway into acapulco was blocked by landslides for most of wednesday, complicating efforts to reach people and effectively cutting off the city from essential resources. by late wednesday, the roadway had been cleared only for emergency vehicles, authorities announced. flor campos trudged for more than an hour through mud along a highway outside acapulco on wednesday morning before she peeled off her shoes, worried she'd lose them in the muck. the domestic worker from a small town in guerrero was among dozens of families, women and children who clambered over tree trunks and other debris left by landslides in the mountainous terrain. it was a daunting escape, but people were desperate to get out. “we had been waiting since 3 in the morning to get out, so we decided to walk. it was more dangerous to stay.” campos said. on tuesday, otis took many by surprise when it rapidly strengthened from a tropical storm to a powerful category 5 as it tore along the coast. researchers tracking the storm told the associated press that the storm broke records for how quickly it intensified, at a time when climate change has exacerbated devastating weather events like this one. “it’s one thing to have a category 5 hurricane make landfall somewhere when you’re expecting it or expecting a strong hurricane, but to have it happen when you’re not expecting anything to happen is truly a nightmare,” said brian mcnoldy, a hurricane researcher at the university of miami. acapulco, tecpan and other towns along the costa grande in guerrero were hit hard, said mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador. he said conditions were so bad that communication with the area had been “completely lost."" acapulco is a city of nearly 1 million people at the foot of steep mountains. luxury homes and slums alike cover the city’s hillsides with views of the glistening pacific. once drawing hollywood stars for its nightlife, sport fishing and cliff diving shows, acapulco has in more recent years fallen victim to competing organized crime groups that have sunk the city into violence, driving many international tourists to the caribbean waters of cancun and the riviera maya or beaches farther down the pacific coast in the state of oaxaca. damage to the local military airport made it hard for authorities to access the region, lópez obrador said. mexico’s secretary of national defense told the ap on wednesday that 7,000 military personnel had been deployed to the area, and that over 1,200 more were on their way. officials also said they were working to restore power and phone service. lópez obrador noted that otis was a stronger hurricane than pauline, which hit acapulco in 1997, destroying swaths of the city and killing more than 300 people. ___ follow ap’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment ___ associated press writers maría verza in mexico city and seth borenstein in

""senate democrats will move expeditiously on this request, and we hope that our republican colleagues across the aisle will join us to pass this much-needed funding.” biden's national security adviser, jake sullivan, told reporters on friday that russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine and hamas' attack on israel represent a “global inflection point."" “this budget request is critical to advancing america’s national security and ensuring the safety of the american people,” sullivan said. the biggest line item in the supplemental funding request is $61.4 billion to support ukraine. some of that money will go to replenishing pentagon stockpiles of weapons that have already been provided. ukraine has struggled to make progress in a grueling counteroffensive, and the white house has warned that russia could gain ground if the united states does not rush more weapons and ammunition to the conflict. “the world is closely watching what congress does next,” sullivan said. israel would receive $14.3 billion in assistance under the proposal. the majority of that money would help with air and missile defense systems, according to the white house. some republicans in both the house and the senate are wary of linking funding for ukraine and israel. rep. roger williams, r-texas, said the president’s proposal was discussed in a closed-door meeting of his state’s republican delegation on friday. “you can't blend the two together,” he said, describing israel as “our friend forever.” williams said biden's proposal is “a little disturbing"" because ""he knows he can’t get it done without israel.” the reaction is emblematic of how biden's decision to roll together several different issues, in hopes of broadening the potential political coalition to ensure the legislation's passage, could also lead it to its derailment. debates over immigration will likely be the most thorny as republicans seek to bolster enforcement. some republicans have said they won’t support the measure unless new policies are added, and it is so far unclear whether the money that biden is requesting would be sufficient. a group of republican senators huddled on thursday to discuss possible proposals that they would support. shalanda young, the director of the office of management and budget, suggested it would be hypocritical for them to oppose biden's proposal after complaining about lax border management. “we will not be lectured by those who refuse to act,"" she said. ""as we’ve said repeatedly, congress needs to take action to provide sufficient resources for the border.” although there was a lull in migrant arrivals to the u.s. after the start ofnew asylum restrictions in may, illegal crossings topped a daily average of more than 8,000 last month. the white house wants roughly $14 billion to, among other things, boost the number of border agents, install new inspection machines to detect fentanyl and increase staffing to process asylum cases. sen. bill hagerty, a tennessee republican, said providing the administration with “more money to fuel its disastrous open-borders resettlement operation is insanity.” ""it would worsen the border crisis, not stop it,"" he wrote on x, formerly known as twitter. biden's funding request includes $7.4 billion for a variety of initiatives geared toward the indo-pacific, where the u.s. is focused on countering china's influence. the money is divided among joint security initiatives in the region, bolstering submarine manufacturing as part of a partnership with australia and developing financing programs for countries that would otherwise rely on beijing. another $9.15 billion is geared toward humanitarian efforts in ukraine, israel, gaza and other places. administration officials said they would determine where best to direct the money once it's approved. connecticut rep. rosa delauro, the top democrat on the house appropriations committee, said “time is of the essence” for passing the legislation. “we will be judged on how the united states responds to ongoing crises, whether we honor our commitments to our allies abroad, and how we care for innocent people around the world caught in the wake of devastation,” she said. associated press writer kevin freking contributed to this report.",Neutral

""we're not going forward today,"" judge christopher lopez said at a hearing on tuesday in the southern district of texas bankruptcy court in houston. ""there's not enough time. people are entitled to the time."" the bankrupt company, tehum, formerly known as corizon health, was once the nation's leading prison health provider. as lawsuits mounted against corizon over claims of negligent care and prisoner deaths on its watch, the companypulled a controversial maneuver, the texas two-step, that involved splitting the company in two. one company, yescare, got the active prison contracts; the other, tehum, got saddled with most of corizon's debt and went into bankruptcy. the case has drawn national attention afterrevelationsthat the judge serving as mediator was in a secret romantic relationship with an attorney representing yescare. corizon's two-step has also been sharply criticized by lawmakers, including sen. elizabeth warren, who haspromised congressional oversight. attorneys representing plaintiffs in the malpractice suits against corizon said the deal would effectively allow investors to walk away with valuable assets while leaving the prisoners and their families with table scraps. at tuesday's hearing, lopez said creditors deserve more information about the parties involved in the bankruptcy and more time to review the proposed deal before it's sent out for a vote. ""there are still parties involved — and how they're connected, and what they do, and how this deal came to be, and how much money has been transferred, and whether the funding agreement was right,"" lopez said. ""there is a bunch of information that i've been asking for from the beginning of the case, well before we ever got to mediation, and those questions have yet to be answered."" lopez later added, ""i think the fundamental deal has to be reconsidered in light of what i'm saying."" jason s. brookner, an attorney for tehum, downplayed lopez's remarks, saying by email, ""he said he wasn't hearing us yesterday and we should find another date and re-set it."" many of the creditors, lopez noted, are people without timely access to mail — a clear reference to the incarcerated plaintiffs. lopez's decision comes weeks after insiderfirst raised questionsabout the fairness of the settlement, reporting that it would offer current and former prisoners a few cents on the dollar. the settlement deal would resolve hundreds of the malpractice suits for just $5,000 each — even those from families suing on behalf of loved ones who they say died due to corizon's neglect. during the hearing, lopez obliquely referenced the suddenresignationof the bankruptcy court's chief justice, david jones, on sunday, saying, ""a lot has come out"" about the mediation process that led to the deal. insiderwas the first to report allegationsthat jones, who oversaw those talks, was involved in a previously undisclosed romantic relationship with a prominent bankruptcy attorney, elizabeth freeman, his former clerk. freeman represented yescare in the negotiations. ""i have no visibility into the mediation,"" ha nguyen, an attorney with the houston office of the us trustee, said at the hearing. ""but what we do know is that there was a lawyer involved with the mediator that was in the room. that fact is concerning to people."" the office of the us trustee, an arm of the justice department, took the rare step of filinga 16-page objectionto the settlement on friday. the objection not only raised the conflicts surrounding jones' mediation of the talks, but the unique disclosure needs of incarcerated plaintiffs. ""the circumstances of this case, with a vulnerable population of creditors that face obstacles to participation even on regular notice, weigh in favor of requiring more time,"" the objection reads. ""moreover, recent admissions by the judicial mediator may raise issues about the propriety of the mediation that serves as the basis for the global settlement — and thus about the very propriety of the settlement and plan itself."" the trustee's objection also raised concerns about the release from liability of multiple parties whose exact relationship to the entities involved in the two-step was not laid out in the disclosure statement. the proposed global settlement would protect tehum, yescare, and many of their current or former executives and directors from any future lawsuits related to corizon's care. if creditors approve it, more than 350 lawsuits alleging medical negligence over corizon's care at jails and prisons nationwide would be abruptly resolved. so would dozens of employment-lawsuits over allegations including discrimination, wage theft, and wrongful termination, along with claims regarding millions of dollars in unpaid invoices from hospitals and other health care providers. lopez said if his outstanding questions remain unanswered in the disclosure documents, he won't approve the disclosure package, or potentially even the underlying plan. ""there's not enough information here for me to feel comfortable that this disclosure statement — and maybe those parties don't want any more information disclosed — but that may mean other hard decisions get made,"" lopez said. ""sometimes the outcome is harsh, but that's where we are."" the son of hector garcia, who died in august 2019 at the age of 55 after receiving shoddy medical care from corizon at a jail in new mexico, according to his family's suit, told insider that he's thrilled by the judge's decision not to immediately approve the disclosure documents. hector garcia jr., who dialed in to the hearing, said he was blown away by the judge's words. ""it's like a complete 360 turnaround,"" he said. ""i'm so happy that our voice is being heard now.""",Neutral

<… [+8694 chars]",Mexico,"a powerful group of senators have pressed for answers about the bankruptcy of the private prison healthcare provider formerly known as corizon health. in aletter sent tuesdayto executives of corizon's successor companies — yescare and tehum care services — the lawmakers say corizon employed an ""abusive"" bankruptcy strategy to avoid paying not just medical-malpractice lawsuits but also ""bills for tens of millions of dollars' worth of goods and services provided to corizon by hospitals, small businesses, and your own former employees."" the nine senators include elizabeth warren, bernie sanders, cory booker, judiciary committee chair dick durbin, and finance committee chair ron wyden. they raise questions in the seven-page letter about the company's ""largely anonymous investors,"" the company's ""obfuscation of its ownership structure,"" the assets it has transferred to ""affiliated entities,"" and its attempts to escape liability for hundreds of medical-malpractice lawsuits filed by current and former prisoners. ""the bankruptcy system has many aims, but it was not designed to provide an avenue for companies to evade accountability for wrongdoing,"" the lawmakers write. tehum filed for bankruptcy in february — the final step in a controversial legal maneuver in which corizon moved to texas and split in two. as a result of the tactic, dubbed the texas two-step, one company, called yescare, got all of corizon's corrections contracts while the other, tehum, was saddled with corizon's civil suits and most of its debt. insider first reported on the company'suse of the two-stepin august. in the letter, addressed to yescare ceo jeffrey sholey and isaac lefkowitz, tehum's sole director, the senators blasted corizon's attempt ""to manipulate bankruptcy law with the aim of skirting accountability for the harms that incarcerated individuals have endured under corizon's care."" ""the texas two-step is a distorted use of the u.s. bankruptcy system by corporations to evade mass tort liability,"" the senators write. ""your company has taken this abusive strategy a step farther."" the lawmakers urge sholey and lefkowitz to use ""the full financial capabilities"" of yescare, tehum, and other related entities to ""provide full relief for meritorious claims against corizon by all incarcerated people, their families, former employees, and third-party medical providers."" those claims total more than$1.2 billion, and tehum is seeking to settle them for $37 million. the senators have given tehum and yescare two weeks to answer nine detailed questions about their leadership, ownership structure, corporate assets, affiliated entities, the civil suits against them, and the bankruptcy settlement negotiations themselves. ""for too long, corporations like corizon have taken advantage of our bankruptcy system, engaging in maneuvers like the texas two-step to hide from victims who deserve to be treated fairly,"" sen. warren told insider. ""i'm calling for answers from corizon."" sholey, lefkowitz, yescare, and tehum did not immediately respond to requests for comment. corizon was once one of the nation's largest private prison healthcare providers, but claims of malpractice and patient neglect had been mounting against it for years. the senators excoriate corizon for its repeated failure to provide adequate healthcare to prisoners, itemizing what they describe as ""glaring instances of neglect."" the letter specifically mentions the case of hector garcia, a father of four who died three days into a six-day sentence at a new mexico jail, a caseinsider profiled. the letter says ""corizon providers ignored complaints of intense pain caused by an entirely treatable existing condition providers should have been aware of."" as his son hector garcia jr.told insider, ""it's not like he had a chance to call an ambulance himself."" the lawmakers' letter criticizes corizon's use of the texas two-step ""to pay pennies on the dollar to claimants that deserve recompense for poor health outcomes."" and it says serious questions remain about the opaque ownership behind yescare and tehum, issues first raised ininsider's reporting. ""reporting suggests that the largely unknown investors and associates that spearheaded the texas two-step have engaged in questionable and unjust tactics,"" the letter says. ""this misuse of the bankruptcy system is unacceptable, and we are concerned that it may result in the denial of hundreds of claims stemming from the substandard care incarcerated people have received under corizon's watch."" warren had already expressed concern about one company affiliate. in january 2021, shesent a letterto the national nursing home chain genesis healthcare, questioning why the company had paid top executives millions of dollars in bonuses even though it had received $300 million in government aid and more than 2,800 residents died on its watch during the pandemic. according toan alabama bid documentobtained by insider, yescare is managed and financially supported by geneva consulting llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of genesis. lefkowitz, the sole director of tehum, is now also a director at genesis. the bid says yescare entered into a management service agreement with geneva consulting — and the relationship between the two companies caught the senators' attention. they write that evidence suggests ""yescare may in fact be owned by geneva consulting or its parent, the nursing home giant genesis healthcare inc."" ""corizon's obfuscation of its ownership structure,"" they write, ""heightens our concern that the company is attempting to evade liability."" until recently, the bankruptcy looked to be on its way to a swift conclusion. tehum and its largest creditors had submitted a joint bankruptcy plan proposing the $37 million settlement, which would have given current and former incarcerated patients just $5,000 apiece for their medical-malpractice claims — even in cases where prisoners under corizon's care. then the judge who oversaw the settlement talks, david jones,suddenly resignedafter insider published allegations that he was inan undisclosed romantic relationshipwith an attorney who represented yescare in the negotiations. meanwhile, the us trustee program, in charge of watching over the integrity of the bankruptcy system,filed an objectionin bankruptcy court, citing jones' involvement in the mediation and other concerns. in the latest blow, christopher lopez, the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the case,said at a hearing last weekthat creditors needed more time to review the settlement — rejecting attempts by tehum's attorneys to expedite approval. so far, the company has attempted to wall off yescare's assets from tehum's creditors, claiming that the two companies are separate. the senators forcefully pushed back on that in the letter, writing that claims of ""corporate separateness"" are ""a transparent and unconvincing attempt to avoid adequately compensating victims."" warren and durbin have taken a hard line on the texas two-step, which was attempted most famously by johnson & johnson to try to shed tens of thousands of talc-powder lawsuits. five of the signers of tuesday's letter are members of the senate judiciary committee, which held a hearing last month on the two-step with the sharply worded title ""evading accountability: corporate manipulation of chapter 11 bankruptcy."" in july 2021, warren introduceda billthat would have amended us bankruptcy code to allow judges to dismiss a case if the bankrupt company had used a divisional merger over the prior 10 years in order to separate its assets from its liabilities. the divisional merger, legal only in texas and a few other states, is the maneuver underlying the two-step. durbin, sanders, booker, warren, and wyden were joined in tuesday's letter by democratic sens. richard blumenthal of connecticut, mazie hirono of hawaii, jeff merkley of oregon, and peter welch of vermont. yescare and tehum have until november 8 to respond.",Negative

“during the… [+2446 chars]",Nicaragua,"cuba accused the us of fomenting an economic crisis on the island and driving a record-breaking spike in outward migration through central america, in a statement released on wednesday. “during the last months and weeks, the irregular migratory flow of cuban citizens through the central american corridor bound for the united states has experienced noticeable growth,” the country’s foreign ministry said. a record number of cuban immigrants – 250,000, or more than 2% of the island’s population – arrived at the us southern border last year, mostly coming by land via nicaragua and mexico, according to us government data. while the number of cubans entering the us diminished slightly for a few months this year, as many opted for a new legal path to entry established by the administration of president joe biden, that “parole” pathway cannot accommodate all the cubans fleeing economic disaster in their homeland, havana warned. “the economic blockade, reinforced in recent years, causes extraordinary limitations to the cuban economy and the population’s standard of living, which stimulates the migration,” the ministry’s statement continued. the number of departures exceeds the total outward migration of the 1980 mariel boatlift and the 1994 rafter exodus combined and constitutes the largest migration event in the island’s modern history. while the administration of former president barack obama had begun normalizing relations with cuba after decades of the crippling cold war economic embargo, his successor donald trump reversed that process, reimposing a policy of “maximum pressure” on the caribbean island. the biden administration has given no indication it plans to end trade restrictions despite decades of international condemnation. it leveled further sanctions against havana in 2021 after authorities suppressed anti-government riots, which they claimed were us-backed. as a result, the island is facing critical shortages of food, fuel, and medicine, spurring record numbers of cubans to leave home in search of economic opportunities abroad. an unprecedented number of illegal immigrants have flowed into the us during the biden administration, with 260,000 migrant encounters reported by us customs and border protection last month alone – the highest monthly total ever recorded by the agency. there were a record 1.6 million crossings in 2022. while biden has grudgingly reimposed some of the strict border policies of his predecessor, he has also broadened legal avenues for migrants from certain countries considered unfriendly by the us – venezuela, nicaragua, and cuba among them – to enter legally.",Negative

""wounds from these are horrible. a whole leg can be removed. a shot to the body makes someone almost explode,"" the ukrainian soldier said, adding that russian apcs ""are easy to destroy but not good to fight directly."" medium-caliber cannon can engage infantry from a distance or even damage a tank — both of which are uses observed in ukraine, ""and it is apparent that infantry formations fare poorly against cannons if they are not supported,"" cranny-evans wrote. ""they also play an important role in urban warfare as they are capable of suppressing positions from ranges that are likely to be beyond the reach of the standard shoulder-fired anti-armor weapons carried by infantry formations."" people instinctively view the biggest cannon as the best in terms of firepower, but it's not that straightforward. a main battle tank like the us-made m-1 or the soviet-designed t-72 are armed with 120-mm or 125-mm guns that can destroy other tanks from miles away. but those tanks carry a limited number of cannon rounds and their main guns have a limited rate of fire. moreover, their main guns are ill-suited for many targets on the battlefield. during world war ii,80%of targets engaged by the m4 sherman tank were soft targets such as infantry, anti-tank guns, and bunkers. to send tanks after dispersed targets like infantry is like hunting rabbits with a howitzer. that's why tanks have machine guns in the 12.7-mm and 7.62-mm range, to engage personnel or to hit soft vehicles, such as trucks, that don't require a big cannon round. medium-caliber, rapid-fire cannon, such as the m242 bushmaster 25-mm chain gun on the us's m2 bradley infantry fighting vehicle, combine a rate of fire like that of a machine gun with the heavier shells used by a cannon. the 2a42 can pump out up 500 rounds a minute, while the27a2model can shoot 330 rounds. these weapons can also fire a variety of ammunition, including armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds. the m242 bushmaster can even fire depleted-uranium shells against tanks. bradleys famously used their 25-mm guns to suppress iraqi t-72 tanks, buying them time todestroy the iraqi tankswith the m2's tow anti-tank missiles. this doesn't mean that infantry fighting vehicles, if they have a choice, should pick a fight with heavily armored tanks, but medium cannon have proven their value. britain found 30-mm cannon useful in the falklands, cranny-evans wrote, adding that these weapons ""were also used as a form of precision direct fire in afghanistan where they served to quickly suppress taliban forces, and similar outcomes have been reported by french forces fighting in mali."" it's now common for infantry fighting and reconnaissance vehicles to carry guns that would have been the main armament of tanks in the early years of world war ii. future vehicles will still probably be armed with medium cannon, though with some innovations. the us and russia are looking at heavier 50-mm or 57-mm guns that use special ammunition such as the supershot, while cased telescoped cannon offer the prospect of smaller and lighter weapons. the us army also plans to arm thestrykerwith a 30-mm gun, while france and britain have ordered bae's40-mm cased telescoped cannonfor their light armored vehicles. however, nato, russia, and china (which copies russian weapons)are largely usingmedium-caliber cannon designed in the 1970s. as russia is still using cold war-era armored vehicles vulnerable to nato's current medium cannon — amongthose soviet-designed vehicles' many flaws— there may not be much impetus among western militaries to develop new weapons. nonetheless, ukraine has become a laboratory to demonstrate what happens when modern mechanized armies meet in battle. the effectiveness of medium-caliber cannons suggest that as armored vehicles evolve, those guns will remain part of their armament. michael peck is a defense writer whose work has appeared in forbes, defense news, foreign policy magazine, and other publications. he holds a master's in political science. follow him ontwitterandlinkedin.",Negative

""people remember people, so if they think you're stealing, it just gives a bad impression, even when you're not."" bisbee's father — a retired colonel — had also recently been stopped over a missed-scan alert for one of the three gallons of milk he was trying to buy. bisbee said his father was outraged by the interaction, and was so distracted he didn't realize he ended up paying for four gallons until he had left the store. the alert that brought the walmart worker over to bisbee's kiosk is part of amissed-scan detection featurethat the retailer began rolling out to self-checkout lanes starting in 2019 in an attempt to reduce shoplifting. the tech sends a message to workers monitoring the area when it detects behaviors it interprets as suspicious, which multiple current and former employees told insider has led to uncomfortable interactions and evenhostile confrontations with customers who trigger the system. even in cases where theft is suspected, the employees told insider they are not allowed to accuse customers of stealing. but many shoppers shared experiences in which honest mistakes or technical glitches resulted in them feeling branded as a criminal, whether by store workers, local law enforcement, or even the technology itself. ""we're continuously working on our security processes, and we encourage customers with concerns to let us know,"" walmart spokesperson joe pennington told insider. ""our associates are trained to handle these situations professionally and respectfully, ensuring our customers have the best shopping experience possible."" karen baker was pregnant and hurriedly shopping with her 4-year-old in tow when her kiosk kept intermittently freezing up over a missed scan. a former retail worker herself, she tried slowing down the pace to see if that helped. with the help of a manager, she eventually discovered the system was noticing her wallet, which was tucked in her armpit, and flagging it as unscanned merchandise. walmart doesn't even sell the same wallet, she added. shopper daniel jones told insider he was ""appalled"" when his kiosk lit up and began playing security video footage of an alleged missed scan. ""not only did i feel like i was being accused of a crime, i felt confused and upset because i was in my work uniform and other people may see the video playback and think that i'm stealing,"" jones said. waiting for an employee to come over, question him, and reactivate his system made jones feel like he was being ""punished"" for using the available hand scanner to ring up his order. (bisbee's missed-scan alert was also related to his use of the handheld scanner.) since the episode two weeks ago, jones said he has seen two other shoppers apparently caught off-guard and become defensive over the missed-scan alert. ""it does make the honest shopper feel unwelcome, and feel like they are being treated like thieves,"" he said. if you are a walmart worker or shopper who would like to share your perspective, please get in touch withdominick via email.insider strongly recommends using a personal email and a non-work device when reaching out.",Negative

""i almost forget what it's like to be in committee at this point,"" rep. becca balint of vermont told insider on tuesday. nearly every democrat who spoke with insider registered their immense annoyance with the situation, particularly when they mentioned the myriad events in their districts that they had to cancel or postpone as they stayed in washington. it's been an especially big frustration for democrats in swing districts, all of whom need to be seen in their communities as much as possible. ""we're never sure when we're going to be here, when we're going to leave, you can't commit, we've had to cancel,"" said rep. marcy kaptur, who likely faces a competitive re-election in ohio next year. ""that's extremely unfair to the people i represent."" furthermore, democrats had to deal with an uncertain calendar driven by theups and downs of what happenedamong their republican colleagues, never knowing when votes might suddenly be called or when they might suddenly be sent home. ""it's not that we just sit around here and twiddle our thumbs,"" said rep. jim mcgovern of massachusetts.

""canceling and uncanceling and canceling,"" said rep. abigail spanberger of virginia, describing the last three weeks. ""i have what feels like three scheduling meetings a day, because we're scheduling, unscheduling, scheduling, and unscheduling."" yet the three weeks without a speaker also had something of a silver lining for lawmakers, particularly given the hectic schedules they typically endure: more time to focus.

""but that's something they've gotta do anyway."" rep. gabe vasquez of new mexico said he's had more time engage with his staff back home via phone, and to fine-tune and gather support for a series of immigration-related bills he plans to roll out next week. ""we've gotten to do a lot of the policy stuff that we don't always get to do, since we're pretty busy up here,"" said rep. gabe vasquez of new mexico. but without the pressure of preparing for votes and committee meetings, he's also had time to get fit — and start hitting the gym. ""i've also been running a lot, four or five miles a day,"" said vasquez. ""i signed up for the gym. so yeah, i've been playing basketball down in the gym as well."" dogs have also made their way into the mix. balint said that a ""personal source of joy"" for her was getting to dog sit rep. sharice davids' rescue dog, peanut. ""he's super fast for a little three-legged guy,"" said balint. ""we'd be in a lot better place if the dogs were running the show here."" rep. angie craig of minnesota also brought her dog — a 5-month-old cavalier king charles spaniel named dakota — to the capitol for two weeks to serve as a kind of ""therapy dog"" for her colleagues, particularly during lengthy floor votes for speaker. ""dakota's been sharing her love around — on a bipartisan basis, by the way,"" said craig. ""i found out that [michigan republican rep.] lisa mcclain has a king charles spaniel too, so we've been comparing notes."" for rep. don beyer, whose home in his northern virginia district is just a 15-minute drive from the capitol, things haven't been so bad. he's been able to actually sit in on meetings with constituent groups — a task more typically delegated to staff members, given the congressman's busy schedule. ""i'm the most spoiled member of congress,"" said beyer. ""in many ways."" and ultimately, as each democrat took pains to make clear, it's not like democrats were totally sitting on their hands. the ongoing conflict in israel has meant more security briefings and organizing efforts, keeping some lawmakers just as busy as before. ""personally, i feel like i've been running around like our hair's on fire,"" said rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york, detailing israel-related phone calls with colleagues and biden administration officials.

holiday tourism. paola cruz and her nephew, nicolas sanches gallardo, made a deal when they were kids playing in the hills of oaxaca, mexico. they agreed that, when one of them died, the other would seek out a mariachi band to play their favourite mexican songs at the funeral. but nicolas warned paola that if he died first and she didn’t honour the pact, he would travel back to the world of the living ondia de los muertos— mexico’sday of the deadholiday — just to give her the scare of her life. paola is now 70, her short silver hair trimmed tightly above her dark, soulful eyes. she remembers the last day of the dead she spent with nicolas, her junior by only six years. nicolas, his wife and his children had gathered at paola’s house in the santa rosa district of oaxaca for a holiday feast: handmade tortillas, slow-cooked beans, oaxacan stews and pan de muerto, a sugar-encrusted bread that nicolas made specially for the occasion. but when nicolas declined his usual glass of mezcal, an agave-based alcohol, paola was surprised. “he told me his chest started to hurt that morning but said i shouldn’t worry,” she recalled. “his heart, according to him, was simply heavy with the love he felt for his wife.” two weeks later, nicolas died of a heart attack at age 52. paola made sure an eight-member mariachi band performed at his funeral in the santa rosa cemetery. it was 2011, 45 years after they struck their pact. “nico could make us cry with laughter even during the sad moments of dia de los muertos,” paola remembered. “we think of him a lot during this time.” for many in mexico and its diaspora communities, the day of the dead — generally held on november 1 and 2 — is an occasion to remember and celebrate loved ones like nicolas who have passed away. during the holiday, families welcome the dead back from the underworld with offerings at their graves: a favourite snack, perhaps, or a much-loved drink. and cemeteries are festooned with candles and flowers in vivid shades of orange and violet. “occasionally, strange things happen around me during these times,” paola said. “i feel things brush past me or hear strange noises in the house. it’s a little unnerving at first but also a comfort.” paola’s grandson jonathan velasco remarked that even the chillier autumn weather seems to evoke the underworld. “it’s ‘frio de muerto’ or the cold of the dead,” he said from paola’s garden, where a cool breeze shook acai berries from a drooping palm leaf. “here in oaxaca, the change in climate signifies it’s time to prepare for the dead to arrive.” in anticipation of this year’s day of the dead, paola and her family assembled their ofrenda, a candlelit altar she keeps in her home, right beside her dining table. it contains mementos from the past and photographs of her deceased family members, including nicolas, who smiles up from a snapshot where he has one arm wrapped around paola. “it’s a mixture of emotions every year,” paola explained as she weaves through her garden, clipping flowers for the ofrenda with her seven-year-old great-granddaughter, sophia. “but i think this year, people close to me who have died would be happy for me to talk about them.” paola’s hometown of oaxaca is considered an epicentre for day of the dead festivities, with parades and live music taking place across the city. the southern state in which it is situated — also named oaxaca — has the largest indigenous population in all of mexico, and the holiday is often seen as a fusion of european and pre-hispanic traditions. but while residents like paola keep local customs alive, the day of the dead has become an increasingly international phenomenon. in 2022, secretary of tourism miguel torruco marques estimated that2.16 million touristswould arrive in mexico for the holiday, up 95 percent over the same time in 2019. that influx was set to generate profits of 37.7 billion pesos, roughly the equivalent of $2bn. the holiday’s popularity has surged in part due to appearances in films like the disney-pixar animated feature coco and the james bond movie spectre. but that spotlight has translated into fears the holiday could become too commercialised. since 2019, the toy company mattel has released an annual day of the dead-themed barbie doll. and in 2013, disney was forced to drop a bid to trademark the phrase “dia de los muertos” amid public outcry. still, in oaxaca, 71-year-old farmer genaro lopez is optimistic about the increase in attention. flashing an open smile beneath his well-groomed, grey handlebar moustache, lopez said he feels pride in sharing his traditions with visitors. born and raised in zimatlan de alvarez, a town 30km (18 miles) south of oaxaca’s city centre, lopez has been growing “floras de muerte” or “flowers of the dead” for almost 40 years. his farm is home to rows of fragrant cempasuchil — orange marigolds — and maroon cockscombs. one is said to attract souls from the dead with its scent, while the other represents the blood of christ. “these flowers are my life’s work. i sow the seeds in july so they’re ready for the end of october,” lopez explained. but his business took a hit during the covid-19 pandemic. in 2020, lopez lost almost 30 percent of his usual sales. but since then, he said he has planted more and more seeds each year to keep up with the rapidly increasing demand for flowers. “now i can relax and enjoy watching the happiness they give families as they take bunches back to decorate their altars, local cemeteries and their homes,” lopez said. another local business owner, anthony garcia, has likewise seen demand grow far beyond expectations. he creates “monos de calenda”, giant puppets dressed in traditional clothing that are paraded during street parties and other cultural events. it was a craft garcia took up as a child, learning from his grandmother, and he launched the hobby into a business six years ago. “i’ve had to turn down more clients than ever this year due to demand,” garcia said. he explained he recently created 28 “monos” for a mexican restaurant chain in london. “it’s my favourite time, both professionally and personally.” as for paola, this year will be calmer than usual. she will visit cemeteries during the day to avoid the huge crowds at night and spend more time at home rather than participate in street parades in her area. she wants to “enjoy the peaceful moments more”, she said, unless she senses the presence of her late husband, who passed away in 2017. “then i’ll be ready to tell him off for leaving without me!”

""an annular eclipse only happens when the moon is at its furthest away point from earth. in perspective to us on earth, it doesn't completely block out the light from the sun so instead you get this incredible ring of fire around the moon.

""no plausible path for us-china trade should put downward pressure on us inflation comparable to what was observed during the 2000s,"" the authors wrote. however, jpmorgan researchers found that the inflationary impact of doing less business with china will likely be relatively small in the near term — up to 10 to 20 basis points each year between now and 2032.that's the equivalent of a 3.0% annual inflation figure being 3.1% or 3.2%. efforts to ""friend shore"" — or shift some manufacturing and trade tous allies like mexico— could help offset some price pressures. since the turn of the century,cheaper overseas manufacturing costsin countries like china have driven down us prices for goods like smartphones, tvs, and computers. even for companies that continued to make goods in the us, buying supplies from overseas helped keep prices down. between 2000 and 2010, the surge in chinese imports reduced us inflation by roughly 40 basis points per year, jpmorgan's researchers said, relative to a more modest import growth scenario. but times have changed and recent global factors have pushed us corporations tobring their supply chains closer to home. these events include pandemic-erasupply chain nightmares, russia's invasion of ukraine, and chinese national security and human rights concerns. the ongoing war betweenisrael and hamascould expedite these efforts. last year, 364,000 jobs were ""reshored"" in the us, according to areportby the reshoring initiative, a non-profit that tracks manufacturing data, and whose mission is to bring high-paying jobs back to the us. this number, which was up 53% from 2021's record-highfigure, included jobs that had been previously done in other countries and those created in the us by foreign-owned corporations. more jobs could be on the way. construction spending by us manufacturersmore than doubledbetween june 2022 and april 2023, according to census bureau data. us shoppers aren't the only ones who should be closely monitoring the impacts of reshoring, jpmorgan's paper reported. that's because higher prices could make it more difficult for thefederal reserve to cool inflation. ""if the fed lacks the ability or willingness to anticipate and neutralize the effect of this supply shock, it could lead to higher inflation,"" the report said. even if reshoring has a modest impact on inflation over the next year, every little bit matters in the fed's fight to hit its long-term2% inflation target. ""inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal,"" federal reserve president jerome powell said to the economic club of new york last week. if the fed anticipates these price pressures and keeps interest rates higher for longer, this could help keep inflation in check. but even this could have a downside for americans. higher interest rates are making it difficult for many people tobuy a homeandmeet their car payments.

""we will go to any register, and we will help you in any fashion you want, whether it's checking out one item or all the items. any questions you have, we're right there for you."" like what is the point of self checkout if i cant scan one take one  jk#fyp#miraclehandz#wilmingtondelaware#wilmington#miraclehandzgrowthoil@ kroger, meanwhile, is goingall in on self-checkoutin at least one store where it's no longer offering traditional registers. but kroger told retail dive the change didn't result in labor cuts, and it still had front-end staff to assist with scanning and bagging groceries. this isn't exactly the labor-minimizing tech retailers were promised. kroger, walmart, and costco didn't respond to a request from insider for additional details on their self-checkout strategies. industry estimates suggest inventory losses can rise by31% to 60%— or more — depending on the number of self-checkout stations used in a store. matt kelley, a loss-prevention expert who worked in asset protection at home depot, told insider last year that self-checkout forced retailers to make a trade-off between labor-cost savings and the increased expense of theft. ""inherently, that means there's going to be less eyes on a transaction,"" kelley, who's now with liveview technologies, added at the time. ""and there's going to be more of an opportunity for the dishonest people to be dishonest."" walmart and kroger use sophisticated video-monitoring and sensor tech to track merchandise through stores and self-checkout lanes. but some shoppers told insider they stillsaw unpaid items pass without raising alarm. missed or skipped scans are not always intentional — people and machines make mistakes. in any case, the solution appears to be the same: assigning employees to monitor and assist customers. christopher andrews, a drew university sociologist who wrote ""the overworked consumer,"" toldcnnlast year that, far from being the autonomous money collectors retailers were hoping for, self-checkout stations required supervision, maintenance, and it support. self-checkout ""delivers none of what it promises,"" he told the outlet. to be sure, many retailers are still investing in the technology. but some appear to be reconsidering how they use it and whether to bring more humans into the process so it runs smoothly.",Neutral

(the move likely dooms the prospects of blake masters, the unsuccessful 2022 senate nominee who the wall street journalpreviously reportedhad been set to jump into the 2024 senate race.) but with the realization that she'll be running in one of the most competitive swing states in the country, she eschewed any fixation on ""fraud"" and instead emphasized a desire for election integrity. ""fighting for honest elections is not a republican issue. it's not a democrat issue. it's an american issue,"" she said at the rally. while lake may still harbor resentment toward her own gubernatorial loss, the electorate in 2024 will be focused on the future — and not on the 2022 results. lake during her 2022 campaign ran as someone far removed from the traditional arizona-style republicanism defined by politicians like former gov. doug ducey, former sen. jon kyl, and the late sen. john mccain. she reveled in the fact that she won the gop gubernatorial primary over the establishment's choice, attorney and former arizona board of regents member karrin taylor robson. but as lake looks to 2024 — in what will be an expensive race should she win the gop senate nomination — she has already met with key washington republicans. politico on wednesdayreportedthat during lake's visit to capitol hill, she spoke with sen. john barrasso of wyoming, the chair of the senate republican conference, along with sen. john cornyn of texas. and lake also met with sen. steve daines of montana, the chair of the national republican senatorial committee, according to politico. seeking inroads with allies of senate minority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky will only help lake down the line if she secures the gop nomination. lake may find herself in a unique contest with independent sen. kyrsten sinema — who officiallyleftthe democratic party last year but has largely maintained a similar voting record — and democratic rep. ruben gallego. gallego remains the favorite to win the democratic nomination, while sinema has not yet announced if she'll seek reelection. but a three-way contest may benefit gallego the most, as recent polling suggests that sinema could actually pull more support from a republican candidate than gallego. inan emerson college pollreleased in august, before lake entered the race, gallego led with 36% support, followed by republican pinal county sheriff mark lamb (who'sbeen in the racesince april) at 29% and sinema with 21% support — while 15% of respondents were undecided. as more polling reflective of lake's entry into the race emerges, it'll offer a better view of lake's competitiveness in the senate contest. in last year's gubernatorial election, lake earned 49.6% of the vote, losing by about 17,000 votes out of nearly 2.6 million ballots cast. but the dynamics in 2024 will be different, and in a three-way contest, lake will need to appeal to the independents and moderate republicans who turned away from her campaign last year. in lake's speech on tuesday, early signs of such an effort were seemingly underway as she focused heavily on the economic concerns of arizonans across the political spectrum. ""there is not a gas pump out there for republicans, and one for democrats, right?"" she told the crowd. only time will tell if lake can convince many swing voters to give her a second look.",Neutral

""this is proof of exxon's strategy to stay in oil and gas as long as possible,"" mark van baal, founder of the activist shareholder group follow this, told insider. ""it shows that the company doesn't think there's any chance the world will achieve the paris agreement, because if they did, they wouldn't buy new assets."" nearly 200 countries adopted the paris agreement in 2016 that aims to limit global temperatures from rising above catastrophic levels. thousands of the world's largest companies made similar promises. yet greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise,largely driven by burning fossil fuels. renewables like solar and wind are gaining ground, but not fast enough, according to climate and energy analysts. oil majorsare under less pressure from investorsand asset managers to accelerate their decarbonization plans after earning record profits last year. the war in ukraine sent energy prices soaring and led europe to search for new gas suppliers. meanwhile, the world is still approving new oil and gas projects,with the us leading the way. big banksare willing to finance that expansion, even as they pledge to achieve net-zero emissions on their balance sheets by 2050. given the trends, it's no surprise that exxon opted to buy pioneer. many of the company's oil and gas fields are still untapped, and new wells pay back in less than two years, analysts at wood mackenzie said in a note. if the deal gets antitrust approval, exxon would immediately double its supplies to 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, with a goal to boost production to 2 million barrels a day by 2027. the deal secures decades of supply for exxon's growing plastics, chemicals, and liquified natural gas businesses, according to wood mackenzie, a global research and consultancy firm. exxon already had plans to ramp up production in the permian basin before announcing the deal, even as pioneer's ceo scott sheffieldearlier this year predictedthat oil production could peak in the permian in five to six years. us oil majors have resisted pressure to diversify into renewables like solar and wind, arguing that natural gas is a transition fuel because it produces fewer emissions than coal. exxon has instead focused on reducing methane leaks along its infrastructure and developing nascent technology that captures carbon emissions at power plants. but those investments are a fraction of exxon's spending on oil and gas development through 2027, whichwill account for some 70% of capital expenditures. exxon didn't respond to insider's request for comment. the international energy agency for the first time in september predicted that fossil fuels — which meet 80% of the world's energy demand — will hit peak demand this decade. ""our latest projections show that the growth of electric vehicles around the world, especially in china, means oil demand is on course to peak before 2030,"" fatih birol, executive director of the iea,said in an op-ed in the financial times. even so, fossil fuels are still expected to account for half of the world's energy mix by 2050, which is nowhere near the steep drop that's needed to hit global climate goals. exxon recentlyforecast that oil, gas, and coal will account for 68% of the energy mixby that date. some analysts viewed the exxon-pioneer merger as a sign that an era of major fossil fuel growth is coming to a close. they predicted similar mergers on the horizon for other companies like chevron and shell. ""this deal is about scale and efficiency,"" andrew logan, senior director of oil and gas at ceres, a sustainability nonprofit that works with investors, told insider. he added that exxon could've made a worse deal, given its clear track record of doing little to tackle climate change. the deal reflects how many investors think they have to choose between profits and protecting the planet, van baal said. ""i really think that shareholders should think again about how they deal with the oil industry,"" van baal said. ""they will have to pay for the consequences eventually.""",Negative

""it was like being underwater for a long time, and then coming up for air,"" she remembered telling her sister, still in ukraine, over a late-night phone call through which air sirens could be heard in the background. akimova's sing-songy voice shifts from a bubbly tone to exasperation in seconds as she reflects on her journey from a war that has raged in some form since 2014. ten days into russia's full-scale invasion of ukraine, akimova found herself and her daughter sheltering from warplanes in the underground parking garage of their apartment building in odesa, she told insider. she was sick with a cold, and her fridge was empty. within 24 hours, grocery stores in her city were out of food, and the pharmacies, which she hadn't had time to pass by in the days before the invasion, were out of medicine. she worried, too, that her daughter would get pneumonia sleeping on the frigid concrete where cars parked, with just a few blankets to keep her warm. her idyllic lifestyle — working as a teacher, later designing floral arrangements, and finally as a makeup artist — faded away, and she decided to create the safest possible life for herself and her daughter. they trudged 5 miles by foot from a border crossing backed up with cars to the other side of the moldovan border, where they were met by some of her karate teammates from ukraine, who helped them get tickets aboard a rickety train to romania. the train was repurposed to help resettle migrants at the start of the full-scale invasion. its roof was riddled with holes. it was the first time they could fall asleep — on each other's shoulders, with no fear of bombardment — in days. in romania, akimova and her daughter waited for half a day until a czech relative arrived and invited them to live with them in prague for a month. then, akimova and her daughter took the leap and decided to try to gain entry into the us and join akimova's partner, a ukrainian who lives in los angeles. they flew to mexico, where they first tried to cross the border at tijuana, but turned away when they saw the crowds at the crossing. they were later driven by ukrainian volunteers to the mexicali-calexico border, where, after four hours, they were granted humanitarian parole in the us. the journey was arduous, and the following months weighed heavily on akimova as she tried to make sense of her new immigration status and navigate with minimal english skills. after enlisting in esl classes and registering her daughter in a public school, her day-to-day life in los angeles felt more stable. still, she ached for her homeland. her attempts to make tvarog, a pillowy fermented farmer's cheese popular in ukraine, didn't help. begrudgingly picking up ingredients from a russian store, she mixed the warmed milk with vinegar as she always had, watching the whey separate and the cheese curdle. but when she strained the fluffy mixture with cheesecloth and added buttermilk, something was off — either the american buttermilk or the absence of odesa's water. it wasn't until she set foot in poddubnov's gym that she felt at home. ""in my country when i practiced karate, i was really organized: if you have a problem, you should go work out; if you're happy, you should go work out; if you need to solve a problem, you should work out,"" akimova told insider. ""it was like medicine for everything. and here, it's the same."" akimova is one of the more than 270,000 ukrainians who have arrived in the us since russia invaded ukraine. at least 25,000 of them entered the us through the southern border in 2022, before the us government established the uniting for ukraine program in april of that year, according to the nonprofit lutheran immigration and refugee service. but the bulk of new ukrainians — at least 146,000 fleeing the war — have been resettled through the parole program, according to lirs. the sponsorship program allows ukrainians to live in the us for two years on a faster track to citizenship. more than 1.7 million americans have applied to be sponsors, lirs told insider. krish o'mara vignarajah, the president of lirs, told insider that parole status did not necessarily create a clear path to be granted asylum and later permanent residency. so in august, the department of homeland securityextendedtemporary protected status for ukrainians until april 2025, providing more options for ukrainians to try to extend their refuge in the us. in july 2022, akimova and arina were granted tps, which made their place in the us slightly more rooted. but there are still uniting factors making life in the us difficult for many new ukrainians like akimova, regardless of immigration status. for one, akimova and arina arrived at a time whenhistoric 8.3% inflationcaused the cost of living in the us to skyrocket, especially compared to the cost of living in ukraine. and many parolees that arrived are women and children, according to lirs, creating issues in terms of securing childcare and employment. on a weekly basis, akimova has been working against the clock with her immigration lawyer, trying to secure an extension to her and arina's tps status. ""in general, we've seen the ukrainians we serve struggle with the uncertainty of what will happen after parole and whether they will be approved for another status like tps or asylum,"" vignarajah told insider. ""ukrainians are also experiencing the trauma of losing their homes and being separated from family and loved ones."" increasingly, akimova's future here is materializing after a relative shipped akimova's master's degree to her home in los angeles — which allowed her to begin community college classes in english and art in the late summer. the gym, too, has been poddubnov's place of refuge. it's marked with the slogan ""no nationality, no skin color, no politics: only boxing."" he cuts a stoic and alert figure in the gym, in one breath shouting instructions, cracking a joke in the next, over a rotating soundtrack of russian tech house or american gangster rap. before their paths aligned at eastern block boxing, poddubnov fought as an amateur boxer in russia. he later entered local politics, getting a job as a vice mayor in the industrial russian city of volzhsky, a dozen miles from the famed world war ii battle of stalingrad. ""my life was pretty good,"" poddubnov told insider. ""if it wasn't for politics, maybe i'd still be there. in russia, if you don't agree with something, you will go to jail; you have a choice: jail or usa."" poddubnov told insider he was run out as volzhsky's vice mayor in 2016, after that year's legislative and state elections, as vladimir putin's allies took over the region's governorship and brought a corruption case against him and local mayors, clearing house and ensuring that allies took their spots. the same year, what he felt was a phony corruption case against him was heating up, poddubnov would kiss his young daughter one last time late at night and take a flight to the us with $3,000 and hopes of reviving his boxing career. but soon after arriving in the us, he mixed with the wrong crowd, he told insider, and served close to two years across six federal prisons after he became a driver involved in a 25-person money-laundering ring run by eastern europeans across the us, according to court documents. while in the prison system, poddubnov trained groups of men and was encouraged by fellow prisoners to open his own gym after his release. in december of last year, after over a year of freedom and training clients in his backyard, poddubnov opened eastern block boxing. the soviet style is characterized by long-distance jabs and straight right hands, hooks with palms facing down, a pendulum step, and shifty angular footwork. it was popularized by the height of the cold war and shared by former members of the soviet union and is still used by ukrainian and russian fighters, as well as fighters from other former soviet countries. ""beautiful,"" poddubnov says to akimova during their training one balmy summer morning. ""this is soviet union boxing, keeping your distance."" multiple times a week, akimova tells poddubnov what is going on with her community in ukraine, and they lament how close many russians and ukrainians were before the war. on her instagram, akimova routinely speaks out against the war, calling russia a ""terrorist state"" for its actions. poddubnov agrees with the political assessment. ""it's very good that we live here, on the other side,"" poddubnov told insider. ""here you see it like a tennis match, and you can understand what is going on. in russia, people don't see this, they see the 'special military operation.'"" poddubnov doesn't plan to go back to russia any time soon, in part because he fears he may be conscripted. ""for what would i go? to kill her family? what did they do to me?"" poddubnov said as akimova looked down solemnly. by august, akimova secured full travel authorization outside the us — and she considered visiting relatives in odesa and kyiv for two weeks. instead, she registered for more community college classes. her home is now in los angeles and in the boxing gym.",Neutral

""this is in a village that had been occupied twice,"" she explained, showing the republican staffer photos of a school that, ""as you can see, has just been demolished."" ""i can show you three more schools that look that bad or worse,"" she added. ""the pictures don't even do it justice. i mean, it's unreal."" another activist came with a reminder that ukraine, though a victim, is capable of defending itself. he had a bookmark, handmade in bucha — where occupying russian forces are believed to haveexecuted hundreds of civilianslast year — but fashioned not out of paper but the plastic container used to hold one of the 155mm artillery shells that the united states has shipped to ukraine since february 2022. ""it was fired during the summertime,"" he explained. ""we were told to bring that stuff back and thank americans."" the pair of activists — paige barrows, who fell in love with ukraine while serving in the peace corps, returning a few months back to deliver humanitarian aid, and ryan meyer, who quit an office job in oklahoma to spend most of the last year helping deliver supplies to front-line communities — were in washington with hundreds of others for a summit aimed at bolstering support in both parties for providing the means for kyiv to beat back the russian invasion. on the day of their meeting, the house of representatives was still without a speaker, in part due to an internal gop fight over ukraine. a majority of republican lawmakers are no longer so sure, at least publicly, that defending kyiv from the kremlin is in america's strategic interests. on tuesday,hundreds of pro-ukraine activists, including a ukrainian soldierusing his vacation time, were on capitol hill to reverse that trend, urging lawmakers to support president joe biden's proposal for an additional $60 billion in aid, much of it to replenish depleted us arms stockpiles, and other legislation aimed at undermining russia's war effort. one measure, which activists stressed in their meetings, would authorize the biden administration totransfer the kremlin's frozen assetsto ukraine, effectively answering a right-wing critique — ""why should we pay for this?"" — by suggesting that russia foot the bill for ukraine's reconstruction. sen. markwayne mullin of oklahoma, who the activists met with tuesday afternoon, is about as conservative as they come, advocating a national ban on abortion and,in 2021, citing false claims of voter fraud to justify throwing out electoral votes from some battleground states. but unlike some louder voices in his party, including former president donald trump (who he endorsed earlier this year), mullin has been a reliable supporter of ukraine, something he didn't shy away from when campaigning last year against a pair ofrepublican primary opponentswho were either skeptical or outright opposed to more aid. in september, politicoreported thatmullin also appeared to have convinced his republican colleagues in the house, at least temporarily, not to hold up aid to ukraine over other political concerns, namely the us-mexico border. a member of the senate armed services committee, mullin's support appears steadfast. the senator posed for a photo tuesday with a ukrainian flag and told activists at the meeting — attended by insider — that he plans to visit the country again early next year. scenes of war and its devastation, the senator said, are not something one can soon forget. ""it's a different world,""he said on tuesday [to the activists? during the meeting?]. ""when you see it and smell it, and you see just what humans are capable of doing, it takes away that innocence."" whether mullin's constituents will remain on board, however, is another question. republican lawmakers are responding to concerns expressed by republican voters — the people who will ultimately decide their political future. a majority of them are telling pollsters that enough is enough. ""mixed."" that's how jack a. edwards, a legislative aide to mullin, described the calls that the senator's office has been receiving about ukraine in recent weeks. there's been support, opposition, and support but with concerns about oversight, he said. ""oklahoma's no different than the rest of the country there."" what helps, he continued, is visits from activists like barrows and meyer, who can share information gleaned from their own trips to ukraine. such anecdotes can better inform lawmakers about the reality on the ground — and how us support makes a difference — but also, those lawmakers can, in turn, better inform their voters and shape the narratives in conservative and mainstream media. kate tremont, a pro-ukraine activist who lives in washington, told insider that's something friends of the country will need to focus on going forward, especially as partisanship increases ahead of the 2024 election. ""it's human nature to feel separated from something so far away, and i think that's both a thing that works against us and a thing that we can use by finding ways to connect people,"" she said, speaking as a jazz ensemble played at a reception for activists at the ukraine house, which works with the ukrainian embassy to promote the country's culture and interests in washington. when the conflict is so removed from one's life that it doesn't even seem real, tremont said, it's easier to believe ""propaganda on the internet."" what she wants to see more of is initiatives pairing up regular americans with regular ukrainians, such as programs that allow english speakers to teach their language over zoom to people living in a conflict zone. the more such connections people make, the fewer calls senators will receive urging them to cut ukraine loose, or at least that's one of the hopes. ""programs like that are really clever and creative ways to get people to get to know each other,"" she said. ""we live in a world where you're no longer constrained by your neighborhood to make friends. you can make friends all over the world, and we aren't using that — and we need to use it.""",Neutral

""six to 12 inches of rain is what is generally forecast, but there could be pockets of up to 18 inches of rain and we do think that will be the most significant impact that could result in flash and urban flooding and mudslides,” he said. baja california sur gov. victor castro said via the platform x that “because it's moving slowly, greater damages are anticipated.” but little damage was initially reported. some trees and power poles were down, but there were no reports of injuries. police in san jose del cabo rescued two people from their truck when a surging stream swept it away early saturday. some informal settlements, away from the hotels that serve tourists, were isolated by rising water. some neighborhoods lost electricity and internet service. the federal government posted 500 marines to the resort to help with storm preparations. by late morning, the area's streets were littered with palm fronds and other debris, and essentially deserted except for occasional military patrols. strong winds whipped traffic signs, trees and power lines. hotels in los cabos, which are largely frequented by foreign tourists, remained about three-quarters full and visitors made no major moves to leave en masse, officials said. the local hotel association estimated about 30,000 tourists were in cabo san lucas and san jose del cabo on friday. airports were closed. san jose del cabo airport director francisco villaseñor said he expected flights to resume by midday sunday. the u.s. national hurricane center said tammy came ashore saturday night with 85 mph (140 kph) winds. the hurricane was moving north-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph) and by late saturday was centered 15 miles (25 kilometers) north-northwest of barbuda. hurricane warnings remained in effect for the islands of barbuda, anguilla, st. martin and st. barthelmy. the warning was lifted for antigua. the hurricane center said that “heavy rainfall and flooding (are) likely over much of the lesser antilles.” tammy hit two weeks after tropical storm phillippe swept by antigua and barbuda dumping six to eight inches of rain and plunging both islands into darkness. the slow-moving system was forecast to bring up to 12 inches over a twin island nation, where the devastation of hurricane irma in 2017 and philippe's recent wind damage and flooding were still fresh memories. “this means therefore, that the earth is still somewhat saturated and with additional rainfall, the potential for flooding is elevated,” prime minister gaston browne said in a nationwide broadcast friday. he urged residents to take all necessary steps to secure life and property. government offices, banks and most non-retail businesses closed early on friday to allow staff to prepare. residents’ rushed to stock up on necessities, causing gridlock throughout st john’s and near popular shopping centers and supermarkets. local disaster management officials announced plans to open about 40 shelters in communities throughout the country. ___ associated press writer anika kentish in st. john's, antigua, contributed to this report. ___ follow ap’s climate coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",Neutral

creating a colossal fracking operator in west texas. including debt, exxon is committing about $64.5 billion to the acquisition, leaving no doubt of the texas energy company's commitment to fossil fuels as energy prices surge. pioneer shareholders will receive 2.32 shares of exxon for each pioneer share they own. “i think fossil fuels, as the world looks to transition and find lower sources of affordable energy with lower emissions, fossil fuels oil and gas are going to continue to play a role over time,” exxon mobil ceo darren woods said during an interview with cnbc. “that may diminish with time. the rate of that is, i think, not very clear at this stage. but it will be around for a long time.” woods explained that exxon and pioneer will be able to use their combined capabilities to drive down emissions and produce lower carbon intensity oil and gas. exxon purchased xto energy in 2009 for approximately $36 billion. in the late 1990s, the merger between exxon and mobil was valued around $80 billion. the deal with pioneer natural vastly expands exxon's presence in the permian basin, a massive oilfield that straddles the border between texas and new mexico. drilling the permian accounted for 18% of all u.s. natural gas production last year, according to the u.s. energy information administration. pioneer's more than 850,000 net acres in the midland basin will be combined with exxon’s 570,000 net acres in the delaware and midland basin, nearly contiguous fields that will allow the combined company to trim costs. woods said in prepared remarks that the combined company will have an estimated permian resource of 16 billion oil equivalent barrels, with 15 to 20 years of remaining inventory. natural gas rigs in operation have declined over 26% in the u.s. since the start of the year, according to government data, largely due to the rising costs for drilling materials and labor over the past two years. “their tier-one acreage is highly contiguous, allowing for greater opportunities to deploy our technologies, delivering operating and capital efficiency as well as significantly increasing production,” woods said of pioneer in a statement. once the deal closes, exxon permian production volume will more than double to 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, based on 2023 volumes. it's expected to climb to about 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2027. woods said that by 2027, about 60% of the combined company's production will come from low-cost, high-growth strategic assets, including the permian, guyana, brazil, and lng, with total production of more than 5 million oil equivalent barrels per day. “the combination of exxonmobil and pioneer creates a diversified energy company with the largest footprint of high-return wells in the permian basin,” pioneer ceo scott sheffield said in a prepared statement. citi's alastair syme wrote that the transaction could provide multiple benefits to exxon. “across the industry, the logic of consolidation in the highly fragmented permian shale remains compelling with significant gains to be achieved from economies of scale by minimizing facilities spend, optimizing drilling and reducing"" general spending, syme wrote. exxon is flush with cash. the company posted unprecedented profits last year of $55.7 billion, breezing past its previous record of $45.22 billion in 2008 when oil prices hit record highs. exxon mobil corp. has been using some of that cash on acquisitions. in july the company announced that it was buying pipeline operator denbury in an all-stock deal valued at $4.9 billion. pioneer natural has been making similar maneuvers. in 2020 the company said it was buying parsley energy in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $4.5 billion. it then purchased doublepoint energy in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $6.4 billion in 2021. the boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which is expected to close in the first half of next year. it still needs approval from pioneer shareholders. shares of exxon fell more than 4% in afternoon trading on wednesday.",Neutral

""ai in general, and generative ai more particularly, is the shiny object that everybody's chasing,"" mohanbir sawhney, associate dean of digital innovation at northwestern university's kellogg school of management, told insider. ""and when clients chase shiny objects, consultants chase clients. so they're not far behind."" it's been not quite a year since the public release of openai's chatgpt made genai the hot new technology. with it camepromises — and pitfalls. to help companies figure out how to use ai, the consulting giants are racing to scoop up companies that specialize in the technology. they're also looking to hire people with the right expertise and to train existing workers. sawhney said many consulting firms are building dedicated ai units to help concentrate talent and generate ideas that play to companies' strengths. deloitte has set up a center to focus on ai, while mckinsey held onto the name quantumblack, a company mckinsey acquired in 2015, to concentrate its ai offerings. consulting firms' push to bulk up on ai comes as many workers are worried thatai bots will snatch their jobs. yet in the world of consulting, firms have indicated they plan to bring on more workers to keep up with their clients' interests in ai. accenture has said it plans to double its ai workforce to about 80,000 people. that will involve hiring workers, acquiring companies, and instructing existing employees. demand for ai skills is high. on linkedin, the number of global english-language job postings that mention artificial intelligence technologies is up 21 times from november 2022, when chatgpt debuted, a linkedin spokesperson said in an email to insider.and yet not all ai hiring at consulting firms will necessarily involve technical skills. the big firms, sawhney said, will need people who are conversant enough in the technology to spell out the business value of ai and convince a fortune 500 ceo to spend perhaps millions on an ai project with a consulting company. ""they need ai rainmakers,"" he said. sawhney said part of what makes the genai explosion different from earlier tech waves like the ecommerce surge that came two decades ago is the breadth and speed of the arrival of ai. that's forcing organizations to scale up at a pace they're not used to, he said. here's a look at some of what some big professional-services companies are doing around ai. kpmg said over the summer it wouldinvest $2 billion into aiover five years as part of an effort with microsoft. steve chase, who runs a new ai and digital innovation group at kpmg us, previously told insider the task he's been assigned is totransform kpmg usthrough the systematic adoption of ai, analytics, and other emerging tech. ""we have the ability to be much faster and much more comprehensive using these tools to put knowledge in the hands of someone who needs it to be able to solve a business problem,"" chase said. one way people will remain essential, he said, is to ensure the information and recommendations ai produces have merit. ey said in september it hadinvested $1.4 billion in ai— on technology it uses with its clients and on tech acquisitions. as part of that 18-month effort, the company said it had created its own large-language model and that it will train all of its 400,000 workers on ai. a spokesperson told insider in mid-september that more than 5,000 ey workers had begun training. ey said it has created a platform that helps clients add ai into their workflows. it includes a chatbot focused on payroll that the company said will answer complex worker questions. there are other functions to help clients in areas like managing data and using predictive analytics, the company said. pwc said in april it would spend $1 billion over three years to boost its ai offerings and help clients incorporate genai. pwc has also said it plans totrain 75,000 workersin the us and mexico on artificial intelligence. ""we want all of our people to be skilled on ai enough that they can have a conversation with the client — whether or not you're an associate or an experienced partner — so that you can identify opportunities for us to be able to go in and support that client and that ai transformation, as well as to be able to support the firm itself,"" shannon schuyler, us chief purpose and inclusion officer at pwc, previously told insider. accenture said in june it plans to invest $3 billion over three years into its data and ai group aimed at helping clients use the technology to boost growth, efficiency, and resilience. accenture said it would double its ai talent to 80,000 workers through a mix of hiring, training, and acquisitions. the company's data and ai group plans to develop services and off-the-shelf models for companies in 19 industries. accenture also introduced a genai tool designed to help clients make decisions around ai. bain & company in february said it had struck a services agreement with chatgpt parent openai. bain said that in the prior year it had added openai technology into its knowledge-management systems, research, and processes in order to increase efficiency. boston consulting group is working with openai as part of a broader effort around ai. in december, bcg said it had created bcg x, a tech build and design division. bcg x includes nearly 3,000 technologists, scientists, programmers, engineers, and ""human-centered designers"" in some 80 cities. the investments in ai at bcg and elsewhere could help an unlikely group: consultants who rank below average. a recentstudy conducted at bcgfound that below-average consultants drew more benefit from ai than did higher-ranked consultants. the study, which involved 758 bcg consultants globally, found that below-average performers who used ai saw their average performance jump by 43% in a test involving a fictional client company compared with a 17% gain for their above-average colleagues. deloitte announced in april it had started a new practice aimed at focusing on generative ai. that same month, deloitte introduced a set of services called quartz ai to help clients use technology like genai. in addition, the company has a genai partnership with the chip giant nvidia. the quartz ai services use nvidia platforms. deloitte said in august it's investing more than $2 billion in global technology training efforts to increase skills in areas including ai. in 2015, mckinsey acquired a company called quantumblack. mckinsey adopted the quantumblack name for its ai offerings. the company has a research center called quantumblack labs, which is focused on ai and machine learning; its goal is to support more than 1,300 data scientists in more than 50 locations. the company in june said it was introducing a series of ai-development tools called quantumblack horizon to help organizations use ai. do you work at a consulting firm or a company that's investing in ai? insider would love to hear from you about how it's going — and about the race to hire ai talent. email our workplace team from a nonwork device atthegrind@insider.comwith your story or to ask for one of our reporter's signal numbers. orcheck out insider's source guidefor tips on sharing information securely.",Neutral

""however, data are meaningless without the political will to implement management measures.” the impact of climate change on whales around the world has grown as a subject of scientific inquiry in recent years. many studies about whales and climate change look only at a single species or a narrower geographic area, said laura ganley, a research scientist with the anderson cabot center for ocean life at the new england aquarium in boston. but the way climate change affects the giant animals is global in nature, so the broader approach is helpful, she said. many scientists have said the vanishing right whale that lives off new england in the summer is made more vulnerable by changes to its food availability caused by warming waters. but climate change also clearly affects less-studied species, ganley said. ""this isn't just impacting north atlantic right whales or bottlenose dolphins. this is impacting most stocks in the united states, and not just the ones in the caribbean sea or the gulf of maine,” said ganley, who was not involved in the study. climate change also could affect the distribution and behavior of marine mammals, the study states. whales such as the right whale, which travels north every year from the waters off georgia and florida, migrate hundreds of miles annually to breed and feed. many also migrate across international boundaries, which could require new kinds of cooperation between countries. that is true of seals with large populations in the u.s. and canada, such as the gray seal, the study says. the federal government has tried numerous methods in recent years to try to protect declining whale species, including implementing new restrictions on commercial fishing and new vessel speed restrictions. whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with large ships, and scientists have said both threats are made more severe by warming waters because ocean changes cause whales to move outside of protected zones. safeguarding whales during the era of climate change will require ocean managers to plan for a future in which whale habitats are potentially less suitable due to the warming waters, said gib brogan, campaign manager with environmental group oceana. “this study provides guidance on how managers could prioritize species that are most vulnerable to climate effects and give these species the attention that they need,” brogan said. “if we are going to preserve biodiversity, including marine mammals, ocean managers need to explicitly account for current and future changes in the ocean as they consider ways to conserve marine life.”",Negative

extreme weather events such as thedeadly mauiand californiawildfirescontinue to strain the nation’s aging transmission systems. energy secretary jennifer granholm said it was the largest federal investment ever in grid infrastructure, supporting projects that will harden electric systems and improve energy reliability and affordability. the federal spending, combined with money promised by private partners, could result in up to $8 billion in investments nationally to upgrade the grid, granholm said. “the grid, as it currently sits, is not is not equipped to handle all the new demand” and withstand natural disasters and extreme weather worsened byclimate change, granholm said at a news conference wednesday. “we need it to be bigger, we need it to be stronger, we need it to be smarter” to bring a range of renewable energy projects online and meet the biden administration’s goal of reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035, she said. projects funded by the federalgrid resilience and innovation partnershipsprogram will increase the flexibility, efficiency and reliability of electric power systems, with a particular focus on spurring solar, wind, and other renewable energy, granholm said. the projects also are aimed at fixing problems that may contribute to wildfires and other disasters and will improve reliability by deploying innovative approaches to electricity transmission, storage and distribution, she and other officials said. projects to be funded include $249 million each for rural areas in georgia and louisiana and $250 million for a native american tribe in oregon. the largest grant, $464 million, will go to improve five transmission projects across seven midwestern states, from iowa to north dakota. the money includes $95 million previously announced for hawaii in the wake of devastating wildfires this summer, and $150 million to pacificorp to upgrade the grid in california, oregon, utah and other states. “our outdated grid has been in need of an update for a long, long time,″ said mitch landrieu, a white house senior adviser who coordinates implementation of the2021 infrastructure lawsigned by president joe biden. the grid “is especially vulnerable to the increasing impacts of the climate crisis,” landrieu added. “older equipment can overload during extreme heat and cold when power is needed most. and it’s more likely to fail when communities are washed out by historic floods and decimated by stronger storms.'' the nation's existing power grids are not built to handle the growing energy demand, a fact that is complicated by the intermittent nature of renewables, since energy isn’t generated when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind isn’t blowing. “as we sadly saw in california, aging electricity infrastructure can cause catastrophic loss of life, property, natural areas and forest fires,” said jonathan foley, executive director of project drawdown, a san francisco-based group that publicizes climate solutions. the projects announced wednesday are “exactly the kind of thing that we should be doing: promoting renewables, better storage and better electrical grids for a better, greener, more resilient future,” foley said. in georgia, the state's environmental finance authority and companies that supports georgia's electric cooperatives will team up on a project to upgrade the grid, including investments in battery storage, local microgrids, grid reliability and new transmission lines. the project will focus on remote, historically underinvested communities, granholm said, including rural locust grove, georgia, where she visited wednesday as part of the grant rollout. in louisiana, two projects will focus on helping disadvantaged communities withstand extreme weather and develop microgrids to work with local utilities and back up existing assets. entergy new orleans also will enhance the local grid’s resilience to severe weather, including hardening existing transmission lines and distribution systems to reduce outage frequency and duration. cps energy in san antonio will receive $30 million for a resiliency program, and minnesota-based xcel energy will receive $100 million for projects in texas, colorado, new mexico, minnesota and wisconsin to improve wildfire risk mitigation, including thousands of fire-resistant poles, tree clearing and wind strength testing. texas has faced repeated challenges, from sweltering heat this summer to a winter blackout in 2021 that knocked out power to millions of customers for days and resulted in hundreds of deaths. in michigan, dte energy will deploy adaptive microgrids in the detroit area to enhance reliability and reduce outages. in southeastern pennsylvania, peco energy co. will increase grid reliability and resilience through substation flood mitigation and replacing aging infrastructure. in oregon, the confederated tribes of warm springs reservation will work with portland general electric to upgrade transmission capacity and improve service east of the cascade mountains, including the reservation. ___ associated press writer isabella o'malley in new york contributed to this

""i had no idea what wyoming was, honestly,"" anastasiia pereverten told insider. ""at first, i didn't have any articulate reaction. i was like, 'okay, whatever.'"" it would be, at the very least, an experience, going from a city of more than 2 million people to a state of fewer than 600,000. then, six weeks after she arrived at the university of wyoming, pereverten, 21, had to come to terms with the fact that she couldn't really leave. in february 2022, when russia launched its full-scale invasion of ukraine, including an assault on the capital aimed at decapitating the government, thousands of kyiv's residents were forced to seek shelter below ground in the subway system. ""i had a ticket from denver to kyiv booked for may,"" she said. instead of flying straight into a war zone, pereverten stuck around in laramie, a town of 30,000 people with no public transit to speak of. it was a cultural shock, but it was also a strategic advantage for ukraine: here, in the heart of maga country — a state too deeply red, or at least too closely aligned with a former president for even a staunch conservativelike rep. liz cheney, was now someone who could rebut, with lived experience, the kind of content oftenfound in conservative media. when the war broke out, pereverten recalled, ""i found myself in a position where i pretty much had to start advocating because i was the only ukrainian student on campus and probably one of the very few ukrainians in the state of wyoming."" that's led her to meet with state lawmakers as well as members of wyoming's congressional delegation, including sen. john barasso, to press the need for more assistance to ukraine. this week, pereverten will be in washington to do more of the same — at a time when even republicans who backed aid to ukraine in the past are starting to say enough is enough. barasso, for example, recently accused president joe biden of ignoring the us-mexico border ""to spend billions on other priorities."" pereverten and hundreds of other ukrainians, ukrainian-americans, and their allies plan to romp through capitol hill as part of a summit hosted by the american coalition for ukraine, an umbrella group that includes organizations such as the ukrainian american bar association, genocide watch, and razom, a nonprofit founded in 2014, the same year that the kremlin illegally seized crimea. ""russia is committing genocide in ukraine: mass killings, mass rapes, kidnapping and deportation of children,"" she said, adding that it won't end unless it is defeated. ""there is definitely a moral obligation to step up for that."" on tuesday, people attending the summit have meetings lined up with dozens of lawmakers, during which they will make the pitch for continued support for ukraine's fight against russian aggression. though planned months in advance, the gathering comes at a particularly fraught time: ukraine's counteroffensive has not been as successful as some had originally hoped, and public attention is frayed, another war between israel and hamas having just begun. in september, acbs news-yougov pollfound that 6 in 10 republican voters oppose providing any more weapons to ukraine and half oppose sending any sort of aid at all. more than half of republicans in the house of representatives also voted against the most recent $300 million aid package approved just before the fall of speaker kevin mccarthy. future support for ukraine — the biden administration requested $6 billion — has been a major sticking point in the effort to replace him. biden this month said he wants future aid to ukraine —some $60 billionin total, largely the cost of replacing weapons and ammunition previously transferred to kyiv — to be part of a package that includes support for israel and its war against the hamas militant group in gaza, a seeming acknowledgment of the difficulties of passing ukraine aid alone. since russia's invasion, the united states has provided ukraine withnearly $44 billionin security assistance, much of it in the form of transferred weapons and ammunition, stocks of which now need to be replenished. anna bereznyak, who originally hails from kyiv, will be coming from texas. her own representative in congress is a republican who's been good on ukraine, she said, but she's well aware that the wing of the party loyal to former president donald trump, which just deposed a speaker of the house, is in the driver's seat. ""it's not a secret that we have different lawmakers with different positions,"" bereznyak said in an interview. wisdom lies in knowing who is persuadable and who is a waste of time, she added. ""you wouldn't start arguing with the person who told you the earth is flat, right?"" bereznyak, in an interview, recounted the shock and horror she felt in february 2022, watching from the suburbs of austin as russia launched its all-out attack on her homeland. ""i was terrified,"" she said, worried for friends and family living under a barrage of missiles and artillery fire. that feeling has given way, in recent months, to some degree of disappointment in american conservatives, she said, who are betraying their party's own foundational principles. as she sees it, ukraine preventing russia from taking any more land in europe is of long-term benefit not just to ukrainians wishing to avoid the horrors of occupation but to americans, an argument she — as someone invested in the futures of both countries — plans on making to anyone who criticizes the aid. ""i'll ask a very straight and direct question: are you saying to people in the united states that their long-term security is not the priority for you right now? because that is how it sounds to me, as a mother who's raising two kids who i hope will be living here,"" she said. ""because if russia is not stopped in ukraine, it'll embolden russia to take even bigger steps, and it'll embolden other adversaries."" that's an argument that more republicans made in the past, before concerns over russian interference abroad, in elections or otherwise, became coded as ""liberal"" during the trump era. ""that's a big puzzle for me because, as far as i know, the republican party was formed and stands on the values of freedom. and opposing helping ukraine to keep their freedom is absolutely [the] opposite,"" she said. ""so that's the big question for me: are those people really republicans?"" not everyone who plans to advocate for ukraine this week is from there. from 2010 to 2012 — in other words, just before russia's first major military intervention in the country — paige barrows taught english in ukraine as a volunteer with the us peace corps. after the full-scale war broke out last year, people began asking her how to help. she ultimatelystarted raising moneyherself to provide supplies to civilians and soldiers alike, collecting some $90,000 to date and delivering aid herself earlier this year in a visit that saw her within sight of the front lines. but individual contributions can only go so far: barrows, who lives in olathe, kansas, wants to make sure lawmakers step up and provide billions. ""it's not a political thing,"" barrows said, or at least it shouldn't be. ""that's what i try to really emphasize too, that what we tend to hear, here in the us, is the political side of things. what we are kind of deaf to at times is the effect on humanity."" ""a lot of people that i speak with, they say, 'i just don't hear anything about it anymore. is it still going on? is it still bad?' and i'm like, 'oh, gosh, yes. it's very bad still, and it's harder now because they've been going through this for so long,"" she added. back in kansas, barrows said she sometimes encounters people sharing disinformation about ukraine. she picks her battles and goes in, respectfully, with lowered expectations. ""is it going to change the way they vote? probably not. is it going to keep them from saying negative things in public about ukraine so that other people can overhear it? maybe."" but the real target is not voters, per se, but the people for whom they vote. in the coming days, when she meets with lawmakers in washington, particularly those on the fence about more funding, barrows said she will focus more on the pragmatic, arguably ""america first"" aspects of supporting ukraine, stressing that this is not a question of being more loyal to one country's needs over another's. ""i love being an american, but you can do both. and as an american, we have promised to give everything to ukraine, everything that it needs to defeat russia and to get russia out of ukraine,"" she said. with the 2024 presidential race just around the corner, and control of congress once more up for grabs, it's an open question whether advocates can sway republicans who have voiced opposition to more aid into supporting a priority of a democratic white house. ""it'll be a busy few days,"" barrows said.",Neutral

ties with the world's second-largest economy but seeks a level playing field so that american companies can compete freely. senate majority leader chuck schumer and five other senators arrived in shanghai earlier in the day on a three-country tour that will also take them to south korea and japan. the trip comes amid a sharp deterioration in relations between the u.s. and china and as officials try to lay the groundwork for a possible meeting between presidentsjoe bidenand xi jinping in november. “we are prepared to compete but we do not seek to conflict,” schumer told shanghai's communist party chief shortly after the delegation's arrival. the party head, chen jining, avoided specific issues in his public remarks, saying that a healthy and stable china-u.s. relationship would benefit the entire world. he noted the presence of 5,640 american companies in shanghai, and said he is happy to have the opportunity to discuss how to promote trade at the local level. the u.s. has placed tariff and other trade restrictions on china over national security, human rights and other concerns and blocked access to advanced semiconductors and other key technologies. china has accused the u.s. of seeking to contain its economic development as it emerges as a global power and potential threat to the u.s.-led international order. schumer said the u.s. wants the chinese people to have increased economic opportunity but that many americans feel china does not treat u.s. companies fairly. “we believe we need reciprocity allowing american companies to compete as freely in china as chinese companies are able to compete here,” he said. a series of high-ranking biden administration officials have met their chinese counterparts in beijing in recent months, but schumer and his colleagues are the first american lawmakers to make the trip since china lifted its covid-19 restrictions in december of last year. the delegation of three democrats and three republicans landed on a u.s. government jet on an overcast and windy afternoon. the republicans were led by idaho sen. mike crapo, the senior member of his party on the senate finance committee. schumer is a new york democrat. china, in a statement earlier this week, said it hoped the visit would “contribute to a more objective understanding of china in the u.s. congress.” schumer also raised the issue of chinese companies that have stopped making fentanyl but which the u.s. government says continue to supply the ingredients for production of the opioid in mexico. “they are fueling the fentanyl crisis that is poisoning communities across the united states,” he said. “every one of us knows families who have lost young men and women to fentanyl.” china has said that it maintains strict control of the chemicals to ensure they are not exported for illegal purposes and that the u.s. should stop shifting the blame for its failure to curb drug abuse. in a reminder of the tensions between the two countries, china's commerce ministry said on saturday that new u.s. restrictions placed on 42 chinese companies were ""a typical act of economic coercion and unilateral bullying.” the u.s. commerce department added the chinese companies and seven others to its entity list on friday. it said the companies supplied “u.s.-origin” semiconductors that russia uses for missile guidance systems and drones in the war against ukraine. american companies cannot export to organizations on the entity list without obtaining a special license. a chinese international relations expert said that schumer's visit is a sign of improvement in china-u.s. relations. the senators hope to meet xi in beijing during their visit. “if the talks proceed well, there is the possibility that president xi will meet schumer,” said wang yiwei, director of the institute of international affairs at renmin university of china. “if their meeting is realized, the chances for a xi-biden meeting will become greater.” the white house has been in touch with schumer and supports the delegation's visit to the region, white house press secretary karine jean-pierre said after the trip was announced.",Neutral

speaki… [+4434 chars]",Mexico,"in a rare address to the nation from the oval office, president joe biden on thursday night made the case to americans that it's ""vital"" to both global and u.s. national securityto assist ukraine and israel in their respective conflicts, which threaten broader disruptions in europe and the middle east. ""i know the conflicts can seem far away and it's natural to ask: why does this matter to america?"" biden said. ""so let me share with you why making sure israel and ukraine succeed is vital for america's national security. you know, history has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction."" solemn throughout his remarks, the president stressed what he saw as america's role as a defender of democracy and as a ""beacon to the world, still,"" while seeking to reassure the nation amid a time of rising anger, grief and unrest in the wake of hamas' terror attack on israel and israel's resulting war on hamas in the palestinian territory of gaza. ""to all of you hurting, those of you who are hurting, i want you to know: i see you. you belong,"" the president said. ""and i want to say this to you: you're all america."" biden's remarks came one day after his wartime visit to tel aviv, a high-stakes test of his personal diplomacy and u.s. world leadership in a crisis.  in israel, he expressed unwavering support in the wake of hamas' attacks, which killed some 1,400, and secured an agreement from prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his war cabinet to allow humanitarian aid to enter gaza. but he also urged officials to practice restraint as they ramp up operations against hamas in gaza, where thousands have been killed so far in the conflict. biden warned israel not to repeat what he called the ""mistakes"" made by the united states in the aftermath of 9/11 -- a message he echoed from the white house on thursday night. ""i cautioned the government of israel not to be blinded by rage,"" biden said in the oval office, his second speech there. ""and here in america, let us not forget who we are. we reject all forms, all forms of hate, whether against muslims, jews or anyone. that's what great nations do, and we are a great nation."" biden directly addressed the fear in jewish communities of being targeted, and he denounced the killing of wadea al-fayoume, a 6-year-old palestinian american boy, in chicago last week. authorities suspect it was a hate crime. shortly after his speech, biden spoke with the boy's father and uncle, the white house said. ""we can't stand by and stand silent when this happens,"" biden said. ""we must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. we must also, without equivocation, denounce islamophobia.""  biden's speech laid the groundwork for a large foreign aid proposal he will be sending to congress in support of israel and ukraine, he said -- specifically to shore up their defense capabilities. he spoke with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy ahead of his remarks, and zelenskyy thanked him for the ongoing u.s. assistance. in his address, biden took a moment to reflect on his surprise visit to ukraine earlier this year, first arriving in poland and then taking a 10-hour train ride to kyiv, to mark one year since the start of russia's war. biden said he was bringing ""the promise of america to the people who today are fighting for the same things we fought for 250 years ago."" ""hamas and putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy,"" biden said, referring to the extremist group and russia's president, who launched an invasion of ukraine in early 2022. the president's aid proposal, still in flux, could amount to some $100 billion, including a whopping $60 billion more for ukraine, sources familiar with the draft have told abc news.  while biden did not mention a specific number for his forthcoming request to congress, he called it ""a smart investment that’s going to pay dividends for american security for generations, help us keep american troops out of harm's way, help us build a world that is safer and more peaceful and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren."" the white house's draft aid proposal would also include $10 billion for israel, as well as money for the u.s.-mexico border -- likely an appeal to conservatives who've expressed opposition to sending more assistance to ukraine. but the request will fall on a paralyzed congress, with the house without a speaker since the historic ouster of kevin mccarthy more than two weeks ago. republicans have, so far, been unable to come to a consensus on a successor, leaving the chamber in chaos. the terror attacks in israel have prompted some sense of urgency to fill the void. oklahoma rep. tom cole, while nominating ohio's jim jordan for the post, received a standing ovation from republicans and democrats alike when he invoked israel's right to defend itself. but as of thursday, the path forward to handing down the speaker's gavel remained unclear. biden, who is in the early stages of his own reelection bid, said thursday that it was time to get past the divisions at home to ensure order abroad. ""we can't let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of the way of our responsibilities of as a great nation,"" he said. ""we cannot and will not let terrorists like hamas and tyrants like putin win. i refuse to let that happen. in moments like these ... we have to remember who we are. we are the united states of america."" ""we are the essential nation,"" he said. ""american leadership is what holds the world together. american alliances are what keep us, america, safe. american values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. to put all that at risk -- if we walk away from ukraine, if we turn our backs on israel -- it’s just not worth it."" abc news' mary bruce, anne flaherty, ben gittleson, justin gomez and rachel scott contributed to this report.",Neutral

they always had time. when we did make the move to europe, things continued in much the same way. spending time with our son was a constant priority. people understand the needs of the family in europe, and it's prioritized. european culture is more centered on family, and life runs at a slower pace. when i started working in europe, i moved into a teaching position. there were days when i took my then three-year-old son to preschool and he refused to let me go. i took him to class for a while and the only reaction was one of adoration and support. when we had our second son, i was able to leave work a month before my due date to focus on getting ready for the further expansion of our family. colleagues frequently called to check up on me, as did my principal. when i was working as a teacher in europe, i noticed that although schools are accustomed to giving maternity leave, they need to also deal with a new hire who they then need to find a job for once the teacher on leave returns. what usually happens is that teacher will be needed in another classroom because someone else will go on leave, but it doesn't always work that way. right now at my former school, the gym teacher is teaching the music class until the music teacher returns from leave because they couldn't find a suitable replacement for one semester only. but if there's a standard of maternity leave throughout the country and company, it makes it much easier to find coverage for those nine or more months. after we made the move to europe, i was able to enjoy a long maternity leave with my two younger sons, and i found even nine months isn't enough time. nine months is a developmental milestone when your child is starting to really get interesting and fun, crawling and trying to talk and getting into everything. the biggest difference with taking maternity leave from my job in europe versus the us was that in europe, i was able to extend my leave and still keep my job secure. after my second son was born in europe, i continued to feel the support and understanding of those surrounding us. when my maternity leave ended and i asked the school to take another year off — this time without pay but with continued job security — they were 100% understanding. i finally returned after 20 months and was warmly welcomed. i only needed to communicate with my principal, and they were willing to accommodate me in order to maintain our good working relationship. this big change has had an even bigger impact on my family and relationship with my spouse and our children. living in a society that has prioritized family — from the earliest moments — has been the best decision i have ever made. we have very open and clear lines of communication. our oldest is now nearly 17, and he still calls me ""mommy"" and comes to me for everything he needs, from a broken heart to difficulties at school and big life decisions as he maps out his future. although we have since returned to the states, it has reshaped our family's narrative and allowed us to savor the joys of parenthood in a way i had once thought impossible in the united states. those irreplaceable moments during my time in europe created an unbreakable bond between me and my sons. my american friends envied the quality time i spent with my little ones during their most formative years. these two vastly different experiences shed light on the different values that these locations place on children and the family unit i think those of us in the us can still do a better job of supporting families — and particularly making maternity leave more accessible.if experienced surprising differences when relocating and would like to share your story, please contactjenna gyimesiat jgyimesi@insider.com.",Positive

leaders are in the southern spanish city of granada for an informal summit focused on the 27-member bloc’s enlargement, disagreements over migration and economic competitiveness. friday’s summit comes a day after leaders of the european political community, a forum of more than 40 countries across the continent, met in the city and pledged their continued support for ukraine in the presence of president volodymyr zelenskyy. the pledge was made as fears grow in ukraine that political turmoil in theunited states could delay or preventfurther aid to the country in its fight against russia’s invasion. a rift between ukraine and poland over ukrainian grain exports has also raised questions over whether the eu’s support to kyiv is waning. but eu leaders reassured zelenskyy that the bloc’s long-term support will continue. in aninvitation lettersent to the eu’s 27 leaders before friday’s summit, eu council president charles michel said the meeting wouldbe “a time to look back and critically assess progress in strengthening our european sovereignty, identifying our achievements as well as areas that still require our political action”. he added that “it is also the time to look forward, identifying the future challenges”. an issue that has been a challenge for the bloc to agree on has been enlargement. eight countries have official eu candidate status: turkey, ukraine, moldova, albania, bosnia and herzegovina, montenegro, north macedonia and serbia. georgia and kosovo are potential candidate countries. “enlargement means that the candidate countries have reforms to implement. they know what they need to do. and on the eu side, we need to get prepared. this is the first time in many years that you have a high-level debate on such a fundamental topic and such fundamental decisions,” michel told reporters in granada on arriving at the summit. today eu leaders will address key issues for the future of our union, including our strategic agenda. my statement ahead of the informal#eucoin granada ↓pic.twitter.com/pgylfsbfhr — charles michel (@charlesmichel)october 6, 2023  michel said new member countries should be welcomed in by 2030. last month, the presidents of serbia, kosovo, bosnia, montenegro, north macedonia and albania also said that enlargement should happen “not later than 2030”. but eu commission president ursula von der leyen has insisted that “accession is merit-based”. she says the progress these countries make in aligning their laws with eu rules and standards should dictate the pace of membership rather than some arbitrary deadline. the bureaucratic pace of aligning with thousands of eu rules can sometimes take well over a half-dozen years. in a document seen by the reuters news agency, the leaders are expected to say in a joint statement at the end of the summit that “the future of our aspiring members and their citizens lies within the european union”. the granada meeting will also steer discussions in the coming months on european commission proposals that could lead to tighter controls of exports and technologies, particularly those that could be put to military use. michel plans to work with eu members to assess by the end of the year whether there are any risks to the bloc’s economic security linked to advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum technology and biotechnology. moreover, southern eu nations are keen to address immigration challenges as refugee arrivals and deaths at sea are increasing. on wednesday, the blocstruck a dealto implement changes to handle irregular immigration during times of high arrivals. the bloc hopes to put those changes into law before the next round of eu elections ushers in an expected shift to the right as support grows across the continent for political parties that have railed against immigration. but on friday poland and hungary expressed outrage at the planned changes. poland’s populist government, facing a general election next week, lashed out at europe’s plans for overhauling the rules on asylum seekers and irregular migrants as a “diktat” from brussels and berlin. “we are not afraid of diktats … from berlin and brussels,” said polish prime minister mateusz morawiecki on arrival for the granada meeting. “the plan is to admit illegal immigrants to countries that don’t want to accept them and to impose draconian penalties… poland strongly rejects this.” hungary’s prime minister viktor orban went even further, describing the proposed legislation, which obliges eu states to take in a share of migrants or pay those who do so, as tantamount to being “legally raped”. “there’s no chance of having any kind of compromise and agreement on migration. politically, it’s impossible … because legally we were – how to say it – we were raped,” he said of the rejection of hungary and poland’s stance.          follow al jazeera english:",Neutral

targets, including us lawmakers, united nations officials and cnn journalists,amnesty international saidmonday. the powerful hacking tool – designed to siphon off call and text data from phones – was aimed at social media accounts affiliated with democratic sens. gary peters and chris murphy, and republican congressman and house foreign affairs chairman michael mccaul, according to amnesty investigators. multiple cnn journalists who cover east asian affairs were also targeted. a cnn spokesperson declined to comment. the researchers said they were unaware of any successful infections using the spyware. but the attempt to compromise powerful lawmakers simply by tweeting at them will raise further concerns on capitol hill about the proliferation of commercial spyware. an obscure account on x, the platform formerly known as twitter, blasted out spyware-laced links to targets of the hackers from february to june, according to amnesty. the targets held potentially useful insights on us policy toward vietnam. spyware operators normally operate in the shadows, but in this case the hackers had no qualms about trying to use a public platform to entice their targets. “it was quite a brazen and somewhat reckless way to try target people with some quite sophisticated spyware,” donncha ó cearbhaill, head of amnesty international’s security lab, told cnn. the european investigative collaborations (eic), a network of over a dozen news outlets, and the washington postfirst reportedon amnesty’s findings. ó cearbhaill told cnn he and his investigators are “very confident” in the links between the hackers and vietnam, citing contract records reviewed by the eic between the vietnamese government and a company affiliated with the spyware. researchers with google’s threat analysis group, which tracks state-backed hackers, told cnn the twitter account spreading the spyware appears to be based in vietnam. mccaul doesn’t manage his social media accounts and there was therefore not exposed to the link, said leslie shedd, a mccaul spokesperson. office staffers were not affected, either, shedd said. an aide to murphy told cnn: “to the best of our knowledge, no one in our office clicked the link.” the malicious link was sent in a reply-all on x to peters’ campaign account. “although the original post tagged senator peters, it was not posted by our office and our office was not targeted or compromised by the malicious link in the reply post,” a spokesperson for peters’ office told cnn. “senator peters and our staff follow all senate-approved best practices to protect their accounts, including regular cybersecurity training.” the vietnamese embassy in washington, dc, not immediately respond to a request for comment. for years, cybersecurity researchers and human rights activists have documented the proliferation of spyware designed to break into mobile phones and steal their contents. but the issue gained greater traction in washington this year following the revelation that about a dozen state department employees serving in africa were reportedly hacked with spyware developed by israeli firm nso group. president joe biden responded with an executive order in march banning us government agencies from using spyware that is deemed a threat to us national security or are implicated in human rights abuses. in this case, amnesty said the developer of the spyware was cytrox, a north macedonia-based firm that is owned by intellexa, an umbrella of europe-based companies. the us commerce department added cytrox and intellexa its “entities list” in july, which prevents us companies from doing business with them without special approval. cnn could not reach intellexa or cytrox for comment. “clearly these tools are being exported from the eu to states with terrible human rights records,” ó cearbhaill, of amnesty international, told cnn. “then not only are they turned against journalists and human rights defenders, but also against politicians and institutions who should be meaningfully regulating these exports.” john scott-railton, a senior researcher with the university of toronto’s citizen lab, which also studied the intellexa spyware, said the findings validate the commerce department’s regulation of the firm. “meanwhile, if european lawmakers won’t bring consequences to reckless vendors, they need to get comfortable with being targeted,” scott-railton told cnn. this story has been updated with additional comment.",Negative
